# Down to Earth

This is only used to describe people. So if you say that someone is down to earth, you mean that they are generally quite calm, quite understanding, quite honest. It's a positive phrase to say about somebody.

- Oh, you know my uncle is really down to earth. He always offers me good advice.

- I think it's really important to be down to earth. I think it's really important to be honest and to be kind to people.
