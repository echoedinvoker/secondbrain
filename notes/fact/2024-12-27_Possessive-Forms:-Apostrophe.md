# Possessive Forms: Apostrophe

Possessive apostrophe: To show that something belongs to someone or something, you add an apostrophe and an "s" to the noun.

For example:
```py
"David's pen"  # means the pen belongs to David.
#     ^^ add apostrophe and "s" to "David" to show possession.

```

Plural nouns: If the noun is already plural (meaning there is more than one), you just add an apostrophe after the "s".

For example:
```py
"the shops' doors"  # means the doors of the shops.
#         ^ add apostrophe after the "s" because "shops" is already plural.

```
