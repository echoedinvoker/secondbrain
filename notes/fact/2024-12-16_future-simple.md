# future simple

We use the future simple to talk about actions that haven't happened yet. (It's like to said that we plan to do something in the future.)

**Positive form:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + will + verb + Object  
#                (V1)
```
Examples:
```py
"I will eat a big breakfast tomorrow."

"I'll apply for a new course next month."
#^^^^^^ use contraction which sounds more natural, we pronounce `I` `l-a`

```

**Negative form:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + will not/won't + verb + Object
#                          (V1)
# will not is contracted to won't, which is very special contraction
```
Examples:
```py
"He will not go to the coffee shop later."
#   ^^^^^^^^ we merely use `will not`, it sounds more stress and not natural

"They won't attend the afternoon meeting."
#     ^^^^^ in general, we use `won't` instead of `will not`

```
