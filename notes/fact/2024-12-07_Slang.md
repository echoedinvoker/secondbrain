# Slang

Slang is **very informal** language used in certain areas in countries by different groups of people, which means it's very **regional** and can be hard to understand for people who are not from that area. Slang is often used by young people, and it changes very quickly. 

There are some slang examples:

  - **"Cool"** means something is good or fashionable.
  - **"Chill"** means to relax.
  - **"Hang out"** means to spend time with friends.
  - **"Sick"** means something is really good or cool.
