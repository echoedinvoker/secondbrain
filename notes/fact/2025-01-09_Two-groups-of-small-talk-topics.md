# Two groups of small talk topics



## Small Talk for Familiar People

These topics are great for people you know well or have known for a while.


**Catching up and recent life**

`catching up` is a phrase that means you haven't seen someone in a while and you want to know what they've been doing. Here's an example:

```py
"Hey, how have you been?"
```

**Discussion about work/jobs**

You can also ask more specific questions. If you know someone works at a certain company, you can ask about that. Here's an example:

```py
"How's work going at [company name]?"
```

**Asking about families/friends**

You can ask about someone's family or friends but it really depends on how well you know the person and how comfortable they are talking about these topics. Here's an example:

```py
"How's your sister doing?"

```
