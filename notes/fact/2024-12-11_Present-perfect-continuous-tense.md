# Present perfect continuous tense

It also called **progressive** tense.

We use the present perfect continuous to talk about a past action **still happening** or in effect now.

**Still happening** is the key that distinguishes the present perfect continuous from the present perfect tense.

## Formulat and Examples

**Positive:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + has/have + been + Verb-ing + Object
#             (PP of "be")  (Gerund)
```
Examples:
```py
"You have been learning English today!"
#^^^^^^^^ native speaker would contract it to "You've"
# this sentence hints that the learning is still happening now

"The phone's been ringing for ages now."
#    ^^^^^^^ already contracted from "phone has"
# this sentence hints that the phone is still ringing now

```

**Negative:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + hasn't/haven't + been + Verb-ing + Object
```
Examples:
```py
"She hasn't been sleeping a lot."

"We haven't been working for 2 weeks."

```
