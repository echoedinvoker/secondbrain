# Doesnt float my boat...

This is really interesting and colloquial native speaking sounding idiom. It sounds a little bit strange, but it basically means you dislike something.

- My new work doesn't really float my boat.

- That movie yesterday didn't really float my boat. I wish we would have seen something else.
