# Auxlliary Verbs

Auxiliary verbs are used a lot in the English language. They are often called "helping verbs".

## Present Tense Auxiliary Verbs: Do/Does (negative + not!)

Auxiliary verbs are used to help the verb in a sentence. They are used to form questions, negatives, and to add emphasis.

When using auxiliary verbs, they are responsible for indicating singular or plural, while the main verb is used in its base form (plural and present tense).

Examples:
- She often **sleeps** very late. -- O
- She ~~do~~ often **sleeps** very late. -- X auxiliary verb is plural, should be singular, and the main verb should be in its base form (plural and present tense)
- She **does** often sleep very late. -- O
- They sometimes **drive** to work. -- O 
- They ~~does~~ sometimes **drive** to work. -- X auxiliary verb is singular, should be plural
- They **do** sometimes drive to work. -- O
