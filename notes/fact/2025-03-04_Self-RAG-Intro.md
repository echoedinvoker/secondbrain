# Self RAG Intro

In the following topics, we will continue with the previous graph and add Self RAG after.

Self RAG basically reflects on whether the answers generated by LLM are correct, with a total of two steps.

1. Reflection: if the answer is grounded in the documents, if not, we need to generate a new answer.

2. Reflection: if the answer actually answers the question, if not, it means the documents are not relevant to the question. So we need to do web search and generate a new answer.

## Plan to our graph

We will not add new nodes, but instead add conditional edges to handle the Self RAG part, because the reflection of Self RAG will determine which node to navigate to, so it is more appropriate to handle it on conditional edges.
