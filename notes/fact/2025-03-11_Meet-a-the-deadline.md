# Meet a/the deadline

It means to finish a task before the time limit.

if we use *a*, it means that we are talking about any deadline, but if we use *the*, it means that we are talking about a specific deadline.

"Let's hustle to *meet the deadline*; we're almost there!"

"*Meeting the deadline* is crucial to keep our client happy."
