## 1. Introductions and Greetings - Party

**Sarah:** Hello, it's **a pleasure to meet you**. Am I right in guessing that you're Gary?

**Gary:** That's right, **I'm Gary** from Bath. **How do you** know me?

**Sarah:** Actually, your sister Sally showed me a picture of you only yesterday.

**Gary:** Ah-ha, I see now! Well, I guess I don't need to worry so much then.

**Sarah:** No, **not at all** Gary. **How are you** enjoying the party?

**Gary:** Mmm, It's okay, I guess. I'm not so much of a **party animal**. **How about you?** Are you having fun?

**Sarah:** Honestly, I've not been to so many parties this last year. **I've really lost touch with** my social skills. It's still kind of fun though.

**Gary:** I suppose you've been too busy for parties - kind of like myself.

**Sarah:** That's right! I had a baby girl last autumn, so I've been **as busy as a bee** since then. Babies really do **keep your hands full**.

**Gary:** Wow, that's great news, Sarah! Congratulations to you and your baby girl.

**Sarah:** Thank you very much, Gary. How about you and Sally come over to my house for dinner? My husband is **a real wizard** in the kitchen!

**Gary:** That would be brilliant Sarah. I think Sally would love that, too. **When were you thinking?**

**Sarah:** **I'm free** most weekends. Would that be okay for you?

**Gary:** Yup, that's **awesome**!

**Sarah:** Okay, sounds like a plan to me. I'll let Sally know the date, too.
