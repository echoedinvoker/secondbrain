# Whats your dream job?

Another open question, we can use [[2025-01-29_5-or-6-Ws-for-description|5 or 6 Ws for description]] method to develop our description.

**What**
Well, actually, I'd really, really like to be a policeman once I start working,

**When**
but I'm going to wait until after my studies, 

**Where**
which, you know, I'm currently in London, and ideally, I would love to stay in London. I heard it's the best place to be a policeman. And although challenging, it's really rewarding to.

**How**
I guess after my studies, I could join the police academy here, I think it takes a few months to finish. I've heard it's pretty difficult too.

**Why**
But, you know, I also know the career path is really good and they offer a great pension and there's definitely a good way to work up through the police force and gain promotions.

**Who**
I mean, the reason I want to do this is my uncle was a policeman for 20, 30 years, and he always said it was the great job. So, my dream job would be to be a policeman.
