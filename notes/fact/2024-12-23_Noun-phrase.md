# Noun phrase

A noun phrase is a group of words acting as a noun.

```py
"The train strike began at Liverpool City Hall yesterday morning."
#    ^^^^^^^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

There are three noun phrases in this sentence:

Train strike: The subject of the sentence. (even strike is a verb, it is a noun in this context, so the main verb is `began`)

Liverpool City Hall: A proper noun giving details on where the event happened.

Yesterday morning: A noun phrase giving information on when the event took place.
