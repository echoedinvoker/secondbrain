  You can now open it in your favorite editor.
Next steps:
1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
3. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.
4. Tip: Explore how you can extend the ORM with scalable connection pooling, global caching, and real-time database events. Read: https://pris.ly/cli/beyond-orm
More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started

// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```
