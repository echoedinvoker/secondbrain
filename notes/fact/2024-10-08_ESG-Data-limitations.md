# ESG Data Limitations

Although the ESG data is insightful and useful, it does have its limitations, especially in its current form.

The ESG data is **cross-sectional** only, meaning it's as at *one specific point* in time

In fact, not only ESG risk data has limitations, but all financial data has limitations because we have three #constraints to consider.

_welcome to the reeal world :D_


# Assumption: Not Time-Varying

By using this ESG data to test our hypotheses, we're assuming ESG risk is *not* time-varying

This is not an entirely reasonable assumption, but it's the only meaningful way forward given data constraints

Btw, it is not unreasonable to assume that ESG risk is not time-varying, at least in the short term. 
Because ESG risk values are based on a company's operations, and these don't change overnight.


# What's the points?

- Can we get insights from ESG data? And use it to test our hypotheses then make decisions?

- We must keep its limitations in mind and always be wary when using this limited data.
