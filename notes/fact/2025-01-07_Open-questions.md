# Open questions

There is a simple structure we can follow when making questions.

## Structure

**1. Question word - The 6 Ws**

What / Where / When / Who / Why / How

`Why` and `How` are used to ask for more developed answers. So, they make deeper questions.

**2. Auxiliary verb**

Is / Was / Are / Were / Did / Does / Will / Could

**3. Subject**

The person who you are talking about (pronouns / names / things)

**4. Main verb**

Play / Sing / Eat / Sleep / Laugh

## Examples

```py
"Why did Donna decide to move to another country?"

"Where is your favourite place to relax?"

```
