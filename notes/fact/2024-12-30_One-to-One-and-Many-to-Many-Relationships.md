# One to One and Many to Many Relationships

In [[2024-12-30_One-to-Many-and-Many-to-One-Relationships|this topic]], we introduced the concept of one-to-many and many-to-one relationships. There are two other types of relationships that are commonly used in databases: one-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

**One-to-One Relationship**

We can see that in a relationship, no matter from which perspective we look at it, it is a "has one" description, which is a one-to-one relationship.


**Many-to-Many Relationship**
