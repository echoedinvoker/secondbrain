# Catch up small talk

**Catching Up and Recent Life**

If you haven't seen the person for some time, it may be good to ask what they have been doing recently.

Bellow are some examples of how you can ask this, they are all the same in meaning, but you can choose the one that you feel more comfortable with.

```py
"Hey there! What's new with you recently?"
#           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ these already make a catch-up question without `recently`

"What have you been up to these days?" # another common phrase to catch up someone

"How's things at your end?" # this is a common phrase in the UK, a bit like a idiom or slang
#                ^^^^^^^^ means your location or situation

```

```
