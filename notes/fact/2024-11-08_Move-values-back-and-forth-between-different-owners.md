# Move values back and forth between different owners

This is one option to solve [[2024-11-08_Given-the-ownership-system,-how-do-we-write-useful-code?|problems from Ownership system]].

```rust
fn print_account(account: Account) { // Account value is moved to the function
  println!("Account ID: {:#?}", account);

  account // Account value is moved back to the outer scope
}

fn main() {
  let mut account = Account::new(1, String::from("Alice"));
  //  ^^^  because we want to move the value back to this binding
  //       after the function done

  let account = print_account(account);
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^ take the moved value back to the original binding
  
  print_account(account); 
  //            ^^^^^^^ No error now because we moved the value back and forth
}
```

Above is a way to solve errors generated by the Ownership System, but we have to manually write codes to move the value back, which can be very tedious, so Rust provides [[2024-11-08_Using-borrow-system-to-solve-problem-from-ownership-system|the borrow system]] to solve this problem in a more elegant way.
