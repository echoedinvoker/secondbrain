# Abstract and concrete nouns

**Abstract Nouns:** They represent ideas, concepts, or emotions. Examples include "love," "happiness," or "freedom."

```py

#    ^^^^ 'love' is an abstract noun, something that can't be seen or touched.

"The pursuit of happiness is a universal goal!"
#    ^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^                ^^^^ there are three abstract nouns in this sentence.

```

**Concrete Nouns:** Things you can see, touch, or experience with your senses. "Table," "cloud," or "dog" are concrete nouns.

```py
