# Transitive and intransitive phrasal verbs

We can seperate [[2024-12-04_Phrasal-Verbs|phrasal Verbs]] by whether they are transitive or intransitive.

**Transitive phrasal verbs**

Must have an object/subject _after_ them

```py
"I've always looked up to Bill Gates for his charity work."
#            ^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^
#         phrasal verb     object

"Hello there. I'm looking for a new Smart Tv, please."
#                 ^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                 phrasal verb     object

```

**Intransitive phrasal verbs**

Cannot have an object after them (works alone!)

```py
"She's really grown up. I'm very proud of her."
#             ^^^^^^^^

"In all honesty, it was a terrible break up."
#                                  ^^^^^^^^
```
Although we can still use adjectives to give phrasal verbs more meaning, there should absolutely not be an object after intransitive phrasal verbs.
