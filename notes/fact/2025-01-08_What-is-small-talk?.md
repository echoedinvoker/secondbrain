# What is small talk?

Small talk is a very important and common type of conversation that can happen within our daily lives.

### A Friendly Chit-Chat

(Chit-Chat just means `chat`, it's a colloquial phrase)

Small talk is the friendly discussion usually about **non-important subjects**. We can start small talk topics with a question.

### Where Does This Happen?

Small talk happens in various places such as coffee shops, networking events or even just waiting in line for something.

(Honestly, it can happen anywhere!)
