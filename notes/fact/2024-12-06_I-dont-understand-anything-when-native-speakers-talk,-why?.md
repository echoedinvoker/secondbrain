# I don't understand anything when native speakers talk, why?

Native speakers will use some:

[[2024-12-07_Slang|slang]]
[[2024-12-06_Idioms|idioms]]
[[2024-12-07_Contractions|contractions]]

In their conversation, these are all very common but have hidden meanings, so it can easily confuse non-native speakers.
