# Thats what Im talking about!

It basically means that thay've seen something or we have seen something that we really, really like.

For example, if you're watching a movie, an action movie and a great action sequence happens, you said "That's what I'm talking about!" because you really like it. 

In sporting events, within basketball, if you're watching somebody play in and they slam dunk, you say "That's what I'm talking about! It's so cool!" because you really like it.
