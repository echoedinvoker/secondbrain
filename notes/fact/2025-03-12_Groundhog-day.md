# Groundhog day

The groundhog is a type of animal and a Groundhog day is a common idiom used to describe times or time periods. It basically is that feeling of doing the same thing again and again and again. So your schedule is exactly the same every day.

"Lockdown was just like *Groundhog day*, the same routing day after day after day."
