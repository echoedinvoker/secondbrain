# Modelled Conversation


## Conversation

**Brian:** So Atty, **how's everything** going at your new work?

**Atty:** Actually, pretty great so far. I'm usually quite nervous in a new job, but I've met **plenty of** great **coworkers**. A good start!

**Brian:** Brilliant, Atty. I'm really **pleased for you**.

**Atty:** Thanks, **mate**. My new boss is **so different** from my last workplace. It makes the day a lot easier without having someone **nagging** you all the time.

**Brian:** Yup, my boss is a real headache as well. But I suppose that's why they're in charge. Where is your new job now?

**Atty:** It's just outside the **town centre** in a really **modern** office block. I've got to say, it's pretty amazing. The area is a bit **industrial** but it's still quite nice and clean.

**Brian:** Sounds great! The majority of new office spaces are located in that area anyway, right?

**Atty:** Yeah, that's right. Actually, it wasn't a very nice location before, what with the pollution, but these days it's **so much** better. I wouldn't mind living around there to be honest.

**Brian:** All sounds really positive, Atty!

**Atty:** Yep, thanks for asking Brian. **How's things with you**?

**Brian:** Not so bad. I'm just looking for a new job right now and have several interviews coming up. **Fingers crossed** as I'm ready for a new challenge. **Unlike** your boss, my manager is not friendly at all. I really can't wait to finish work there!

**Atty:** Really hope it all goes well for you, Brian.
