# Indefinite Pronouns

Indefinite pronouns are words such as: nobody, everyone, someone, anybody.

"Everyone **likes** playing games together."

"Nobody **thinks** the Earth is flat anymore!"

> Therefore, when **indefinite pronouns** are the subject, the verb should be in **singular** form, even if we know that the sentence is describing a group of people.
