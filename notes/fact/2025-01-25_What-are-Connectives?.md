# What are Connectives?

*Connectives*, also known as *conjunctions* or *linking words*, are words or phrases that connect parts of our speech or writing. They help to establish relationships between ideas and sentences, making our language more *cohesive* and easier to understand.

> **Note:** `cohesive` just means easy to understand or follow.

Connectives help to:
- Connect ideas
- Show relationships (e.g. cause, contrast, time)
- Provide transitions between thoughts
- Improve flow and coherence

For example:
```py
"It was super cold the other day and I totally forgot to bring my coat to work."
#                                ^^^ **implying** that there is a relationship between the two ideas.
```

Above `and` is used as a connective to imply a relationship between the two ideas. Even the sentence is not explicitly saying that, readers can infer that the person forgot to bring the coat because it was super cold and upset.
