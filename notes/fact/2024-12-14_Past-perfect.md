# Past perfect

We use the past perfect to talk a past action that happened before another action.

So, we actually talk about two past actions or events and we use the past perfect for the action that happened earlier in time.

**Positive:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + had + Verb (PP)
#         ^^^ no matter what the subject is, auxiliary verb is always "had"
```
Examples:
```py
"He had lied to his mum before he left."
#^^^^^^ we could constract it to "He'd"
"We had fallen out by the time we reached the hotel."
#       ^^^^^^^^^^ this is a phrasal verb, which means having an argument and no more friends
#                  we just let the first verb as Past Participle
```

**Negative:**

```py
Subject + hadn't + Verb (PP) 
#         ^^^^^^ always use "hadn't" for negative
```
Examples:
```py
"Sarah hadn't gone when I arrived home."

"They hadn't added their purchases together so didn't know how much they spent."

```
```
