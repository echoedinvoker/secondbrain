# Client State vs. Server State

## Client State

Information relevant to browser session. (ONLY in client side)

For example:

User's chosen language or theme, which is nothing to do with server. So they are client states


## Server State

Information stored on server but needed to display on client side.

For example:

Blog posts, user data, etc. These are server states.
```
