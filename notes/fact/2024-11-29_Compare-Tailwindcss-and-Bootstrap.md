# Compare Tailwindcss and Bootstrap


## Tailwind CSS
- Newer framework that is gaining popularity
- Low-level classes for fast UI development  
- More flexibility and uniqueness
- Customizable with directives & functions
- You need to know quite a bit of CSS (because each class is a CSS rule)
- HTML usually has a lot of classes

## Bootstrap
- Popular framework that has been around a while
- High-level pre-designed components
- Some Bootstrap sites look very similar
- Customizable through Sass
- Easier for beginners
- Higher level components usually means less classes


## Conclusion

Therefore, Tailwind CSS is a **utility-first** and **unopinionated** CSS framework, while Bootstrap is a component-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS offers more flexibility and uniqueness, but requires more CSS knowledge. Bootstrap provides more default components, but may make websites look similar.
