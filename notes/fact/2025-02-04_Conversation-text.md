**George**: Hey, Tom. Thanks for meeting up - it's *been way too long*.

**Tom**: For sure, I don't think I've seen you since like February or something.

**George**: It's definitely been awhile.

**Tom**: Everyone seems to stay indoors after Christmas.

**George**: True. *I've got to say*, I *can't stand* the winter months. So *depressing*!

**Tom**: In my opinion, February weather is easily the *worst*. It's wet, windy and way too cold to be outside.

**George**: Definitely. How've you been anyway?

**Tom**: Pretty good, thank you. I just bought an *amazing* new car so happy about that.

**George**: What kind of car did you buy?

**Tom**: It's a Honda. I think they're the most *reliable* and give the best *value for money*, too. My old car was *rubbish* in comparison, so *disappointing*.

**George**: I saw a recent review on new Honda cars. Really positive and apparently *cheap to run*, too. Maybe I should swap!

**Tom**: *To be honest*, I didn't like the designs at first but they've really started to *grow on me*.

**George**: Strange how that happens, right? I used to hate some cars but really like them now.

**Tom**: The only problem is, my girlfriend *couldn't care less* about cars - she says I'm *obsessed* with it.

**George**: Don't worry mate. Just take me out for a drive soon!
