# Scene and tree

![scene-and-tree.png](../assets/imgs/scene-and-tree.png)

Multiple nodes are arranged as tree, and this tree is a scene, with **one node at the root**.

We create a bunch of scenes and combine them into a game, scenes can also contain other scenes, so we can build a very large game world.
