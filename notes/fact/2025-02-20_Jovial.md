# Jovial

It's a really nice way to decribe either yourself or somebody else's personality. It's quite a positive thing when decribing somebody.

Jovial means someone who is generally positive in nature, generally kind, generally takes things quite easily, not super stressed, not high strung.

It's a really nice way to describe somebody who quite laid back, quite relaxed.

- You know, my friends, they're pretty jovial. They like to have fun.
