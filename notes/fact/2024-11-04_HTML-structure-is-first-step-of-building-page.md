# HTML structure is first step of building page

When we build a webpage, the first step is to create the HTML structure. This is the foundation of the page and is essential for creating a well-organized and accessible website.

HTML structure does NOT include styling or layout. It is simply the skeleton of the page, defining the basic structure and content of the page. It's more focused on the content and the organization of that content.

Semantic, accessible HTML structure is important in this step. This means using appropriate HTML elements to define the content of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. This helps search engines understand the content of the page and improves accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

There are some examples of HTML structure:
