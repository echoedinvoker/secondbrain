# Taboo topic

There are also some small talks topics that are probably best **not talked about** in small talk conversations. They are called `taboo topics`. 

```py
"How old are you?"
# age is a sensitive topic for many people

"How much do you earn?"
# private financial information is a taboo topic in western culture

"Are you single?"
# if you just met someone, it is considered inappropriate to ask about their relationship status

```
