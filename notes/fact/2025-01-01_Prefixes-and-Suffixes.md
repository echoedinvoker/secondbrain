# Prefixes and Suffixes

We can think of prefixes and suffixes as **building blocks** we can add to a word to change or alter its meaning. So, they can boost our vocabulary and help us understand new words.


**Prefixes** are added at the beginning of words to modify their meaning.

Examples...

```py
re- (again): "redo, retell, replay"

un- (not): "unhappy, undo, unaware"

dis- (opposite): "disagree, disappear"

```

**Suffixes** are attached at the end to alter the word.

Examples...

```py
-ing (action or process, convert to gerund): "running, jumping"

-ly (in a certain way, convert to adverb): "quickly, softly"

-able (capable of, or give quality to): "comfortable, adaptable"

```

You can find that **Suffixes** even change the word class. For example, adding -ly to an adjective makes it an adverb.
