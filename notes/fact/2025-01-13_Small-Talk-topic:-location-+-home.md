# Small Talk topic: location + home

A common way to begin small talk is to talk about where we are from. An easy way to begin developing conversations.

Be careful not to delve too deeply into personal and private information, especially if you're talking to someone you don't know well.

```py
"Where did you grow up, if you don't mind me asking?"
#                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                       very polite expression to add the end of a question
#                       just show that you know that you don't want to be rude

"How does your hometown compare to here?"

"What's it like in your hometown?"

```
