# Small Talk topic: hobby + interests

Talking about hobbies and interests is easy, and it's a great way to build on conversations if you share the same interests.


```py
"How do you like to spend your free time?"

"What do you do for fun or hobbies?"

"What are you really into right now?"
#                    ^^^^ colloquial way to mean "enjoying"

```
