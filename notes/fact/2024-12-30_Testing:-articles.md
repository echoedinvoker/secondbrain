# Testing: articles

Fill in the blanks with the appropriate article (a, an, the, or no article).

```py
"I found ___ interesting book at the bookstore."

"She is ___ top student in her class."

"Let's go to ___ beach this weekend."

"We're having ___ dinner at that new restaurant downtown."

"I discovered ___ interesting podcast that covers a variety of topics."

```

Solution is on the next page.


















































```py
"I found an interesting book at the bookstore."
#        ^^ only speaker know which book, listener doesn't know, so use "an"

"She is the top student in her class."
#       ^^^ everyone knows which student, so use "the"

"Let's go to the beach this weekend."
#            ^^^ everyone knows which beach, so use "the"

"We're having (zero) dinner at that new restaurant downtown."
#             ^^^^^^ when noun is meal, no article is used

"I discovered an interesting podcast that covers a variety of topics."
#             ^^ same reason as first sentence, listener doesn't know which podcast, so use "an"

```
