# future perfect

We use the future perfect to talk about an action in the future before another action.
(So there are two actions in the future.)

**Positive:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + will + have + Verb (PP)
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^ perfect tense always uses PP ver
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^always `have`, no changes
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^usually contracted to 'll, which is more common in spoken English
```
Examples:
```py
"I will have finished before the end of the day."

"She'll have spent 6 years in Osaka by the time summer arrives."

"She'll have seen the directions."
# the other action may be implied or in the context
```

**Negative:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + will not/won't + have + Verb (PP)
#                  ^^^^^usually use contracted form `won't`
```
Examples:
```py
"You won't have left by 4pm." 

"We won't have had enough time to save by the time we plan to buy a house."

```
