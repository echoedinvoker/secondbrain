# Comparatives and Superlatives

Comparatives **compare**, surperlatives **show the most**. They provide information on differences, quality and amount. 

Examples:
```py
"She is tall"
#       ^^^^ normal adjective

"She is taller"
#           ^^ add -er to the adjective --> comparative adjective

"She is the tallest"
#       ^^^     ^^^ add `the` and -est to the adjective --> superlative adjective

```
Let's see another example:
```py
"The house is expensive."
#             ^^^^^^^^^ normal adjective

"The house is expensiver."
#                     ^^ add -er but sound weird... 

"The house is the expensiviest."
#             ^^^         ^^^^ sound even weirder...
```
We can found that if adjective has 2 or more syllables, it's weird to add -er or -est. Instead, we use `more` or `most` before the adjective. 
```py
"The house is more expensive."
#             ^^^^ add `more` before the adjective --> comparative adjective

"The house is the most expensive."
#             ^^^^^^^^ add `the` and `most` before the adjective --> superlative adjective
```
