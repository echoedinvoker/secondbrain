# Present perfect tense

We use the present perfect to talk about a past action that still has an effect today.


**Positive**

Formula:
```py
Subject + has/have + Verb (PP) + Object
```
`PP` means [[2024-12-10_verb-forms|past participle]], we use use it in any types of perfect tenses.

Examples:
```py
"John has gone for a walk."
# John went for a walk at some point in the past and the effect of that action is still present today (not home).

"We have forgotten our schedules."
# We forgot our schedules at some point in the past and the effect of that action is still present today (we don't know what we have to do).

# `We have` can be contracted to `We've` which is more natural in spoken English.

"My friends have gotten very sick."
# My friends got very sick at some point in the past and the effect of that action is still present today (they are still sick now).

```

**Negative**

Formula:
```py
Subject + hasn't/haven't + Verb (PP) + Object  
```
Examples:
```py
"She hasn't flown in an aeroplane."
   # ^^^^^^ negative form of `has`

"They haven't seen their test results."
    # ^^^^^^^ negative form of `have`

```

We don't use `has not` or `have not` in spoken English. It just sounds too formal and unnatural.
