# Idioms

**Idioms, or idiomatic language**, are used a lot by English speakers to share meanings in surprising ways.

Usually, idioms' true meanings are very different from the meanings of the words in them. For example:

```py
"Hang in there"
# not to hang on anything, it means to keep going, to not give up

"Face the music"
# nothing to do with music, it means to deal with a difficult situation

"The top banana"
# nothing to do with banana, it means the very best of something

```
There are few things you need to know when using idioms:

**1. Only use common idioms!**

If you use an idiom that is not common, people might not understand you. And you might sound strange or funny. For example:
```py
"Well, does an eagle eat flies?!"
#      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is a idiom, but nobody uses it

```

**2. Apply to your own experience**

First, you need to find the meaning of the idiom. Then, you need to think about your own experience. When you can do that, you can use the idiom. For example:
```py
"I think it's time I come clean!"
#                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not to clean anything, but to tell the truth
#                                you can try to think about a time when you told the truth
#                                and try to apply the idiom to that experience
```
**3. Don't overuse idioms in speech!**

Using too much idioms can make your sentences like a poem. It can be hard to understand and sound not natural.
