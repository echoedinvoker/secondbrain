# What is syntax?

The ordering and arranging of language into grammatically accurate sentances.

```py
Subject + Predicate
```

[[2024-12-20_What-is-subject-and-predicate?|Subject and predicate]] are the two main parts of a sentence in English.

Examples:
```py
"The young boy waited in line at the shop."
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#  subject           predicate, and main verb is `waited`

"The weather this morning is very sunny and cheerful."
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#  subject                      predicate, and main verb is `is`, which is present tense of `be`
```

The predicate is verb phrase that tells what the subject is or does.
