# For

`For` is used to talk about the purpose of an action as well as duration.


"I'm very kind for charitable purposes."

"I'm studying really hard for my test."

So that we can see the action and its purpose, we use `for`.


And we can use it very much for duration, too.

"I've been studying maths for six years."
