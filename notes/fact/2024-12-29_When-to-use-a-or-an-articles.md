# When to use a or an articles

They are all for **non-specific** noun. Unknown to speaker or listener.

* If the word starts with a **consonant sound**, we use "A"

```py
    "He needs a car..."
    #         ^ ^^^ consonant sound, so we use "A"
```

* If the word starts with a **vowel sound**, we use "An"

```py
    "That's an elephant."
    #       ^^ ^ vowel sound, so we use "An"

    "You're an honest person."
    #       ^^ ^^ even though "honest" starts with "h", it's pronounced as "on-est"
    #             so we use "An" still

```

Special attention should be paid to using "a" or "an" based on **sound** rather than **spelling**, so the last example sentence above uses "an" instead of "a".
