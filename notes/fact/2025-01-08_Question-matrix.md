# Question matrix

Question matrix is very useful, we can practice it in daily conversations starting from the most extreme top left and bottom left.

```py
"What is she doing?"
#^^^^^^^ better contract as "What's"

"What was she doing yesterday?"
#^^^^^^^^ there is no contraction for "was"
```
Above sentences are really close questions.


```py
"How might you feel if you lost your wallet?"
#^^^^^^^^^
```
Above is really a question that answers require a deeper response.
