# Two kinds of demonstraives

**There are two kinds of demonstratives:** Demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative adjectives.

## Demonstrative adjectives

Stress and specify the noun we are talking about - they help us avoid confusion!

```py
"That smart TV is not new."
#^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ noun phrase
#^^^^ singular demonstrative adjective
 
"These smart TVs are not new."
#^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ noun phrase but plural
#^^^^^ pural demonstrative adjective

"I think that this book is great."
#             ^^^^ ^^^^ noun
#             ^^^^ singular demonstrative adjective

```

You can found that the demonstrative adjectives are always next to the noun they modify.

## Demonstrative pronouns

Replace nouns in our sentences - they can act alone as the subject, too.

```py
"That is not new."
#^^^^ singular demonstrative **pronoun**, we often contract it to "that's"

"Are those yours on the table?"
#    ^^^^^ plural demonstrative **pronoun**

"Are those yours (keys) on the table?"
#    ^^^^^ ^^^^^ possessive pronoun
#    ^^^^^ plural demonstrative **pronoun**

```
