# Layout

```bash
mattc@x ~/r/my-app (main)> tree src/
src/
└── app
    ├── globals.css
    ├── layout.tsx # root layout, it wraps all page.tsx
    ├── page.tsx
    └── reliability
        └── page.tsx # it will be wrapped by layout.tsx

```

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx
mattc@x ~/r/my-app (main)> cat src/app/layout.tsx 
import "./globals.css";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,  // page.tsx will be passed as children automatically
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}

```
- layout.tsx is a special file that wraps current page.tsx as a child. Just like a global layout for all pages.
  - It just wraps the page.tsx at the same or deeper level, not the parent level.

- The root layout has more responsibility than the page layout.
  - It can include global styles, scripts, and other elements that are common to all pages.
  - html, body, head, etc. tags can be included in the root layout.

- Usage:
  - Persisting [[2024-10-12_Navigate-to-other-page-by-links|navigation]] bar across all pages.
