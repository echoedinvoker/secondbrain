# zero article

Sometimes, no article (neither definite or indefinite) is used before a noun. This can happen for various reasons...

**General statements**

```py
"Cats are independent animals." 
#^^^^ no article before "cats"

# (Talking about cats in general, not a specific group of cats.)

```


**Plural Nouns Used Generally**

```py
"Dogs are loyal pets."
#^^^^ no article before "dogs"

# (Referring to dogs in general.)

```


**Names of Meals**

```py
"We had spaghetti for dinner."
#       ^^^^^^^^^ this is specific, but because it's a meal, no article is used

# (No article before the specific meal.)
```


**Uncountable Nouns**

```py
"She enjoys music."
#           ^^^^^ this is uncountable and unspecified, so no article is used
#                 if we want to specify the music, we would use "the music" instead

# (Referring to music as a general concept, not a specific piece.)

```
