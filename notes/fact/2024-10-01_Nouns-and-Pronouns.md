# Nouns and Pronouns

Nouns and pronouns are used to give a **subject** to our speaking. They are amongst the most common words in English.


## Nouns: Common Vs. Proper

**Common nouns** are for general (not specific!) people, places and things

- "I really like to read younger *authors*."
- "Well, *bananas* are pretty good for you!"
- "You always enjoyed learning new *languages*."

**Proper nouns** are for specific people, places and things (we use a capital letter for these nouns!)

- "My dad said *New York* is a really fun city."
- "*Stevie Wonder* was an amazing funk musician."
- "The *Pacific* ocean is huge!"


## Pronouns: I, you, us, she, mine, ours

**Pronouns** are used instead of nouns and have a variety of uses within speech.

- "*I* never thought this year would end!"
- "Where do *you* want to go?"
- "Actually that book is *mine* I think."
