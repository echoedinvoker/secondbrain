# Comparing connectives

- Comparing
- likewise
- equally
- in the same way
- like
- similarly

We use "comparing" connectives to show how ideas, events and things are _similar_.

For example:

```py
"I find football is pretty boring to watch like cricket or other team sports on TV."
#                                          ^^^^
```
