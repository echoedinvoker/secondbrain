# Small Talk topic: weather

An easy way to begin small talk with a person you don't know (or meeting for the first time), is to discuss the weather.

Talking about the Weather

```py
"The weather is so great at the minute!"
#                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ which is a common way to say "right now"

"The weather's been all over the place, hasn't it?"
#                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ which is a common way to say "changing a lot"
#                                      it also implies that a person is unorganized

"Wow, it's so hot/cold outside!"

```
