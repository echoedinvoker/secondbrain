# Present Simple

A common misconception is that the present simple is used to describe actions happening now, but actions happening now cannot be described using the present simple.

The present simple is used to describe the following events:

**1. Habits, truths, unchanging situations**

```py
"I like eating pizza" (habit)

"I speak 3 languages" (truth)

"I need to exercise more" (unchanging situation)

```

**2. Routines**

```py
"I always play games at night"

"I start work at 8:30am"

```

**3. Thoughts, opinions, feelings, 5 senses**

```py
"I love my parents very much"

"She learns Spanish at college"
#         ^ in the present simple, if subject is he/she/it, add 's' to the verb

```

Don't forget to add 's' to the verb if the subject is he/she/it. That's very important!

**He / She / It / Person's name + verb(s)**

```py
"Katie swims for her local team"

```
