# Small Talk topic: families + friends

Especially if you know a person and their friends and family, it can be nice to begin small talk asking about them.

**Asking about families + friends**

```py
"How's the family (fam) doing these days?"
#                  ^^^ slang for family, more informal, not polite in all contexts

"Got any exciting plans with friends recently?"

"How're your folks getting on?"
#            ^^^^^ slang for parents, more informal, not polite in all contexts


# `doing these days` and `getting on` are common phrases to ask about someone's well-being

```
```
