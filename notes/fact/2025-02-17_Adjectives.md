# Adjectives

Adjectives are talked about all the time when learning English - they are certainly important!

They are used to **modify** (or describe) a noun


There are some reasons why we use adjectives:

**Quantity**
- There are `16` passengers on this service today.

**Size**
- Sorry to say but there's a `huge` queue at the post office.

**Quality**
- Hey everyone, I had an `awesome` idea this morning.

**Colour**
This is a `green` pen.

There are many more types of adjectives, but this topic we'll focus on the qualty of adjectives.
