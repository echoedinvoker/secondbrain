# Push back

We can say if we're wanting to disagree and give an opposing idea, we can say "I just need to *push back*" and then I'll share my opposing idea.

But within time management, it means to delay.

"We may need to *push back* the deadline by a day or two."

"Let's *push back* the meeting to accommodate everyone."
