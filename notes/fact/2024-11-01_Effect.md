# Effect

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let name = $state('');

  $effect(() => {                  // $effect is last resort for producing side effects when state changes
    console.log('name', name);     // you should always try to use $state and $derived first
  });                              // $effect don't need dependencies which is different from React useEffect
</script>

<input type="text" bind:value={name} />

```

Side effects such as console.log() or calling API should be placed inside $effect. If the requirement is to obtain a new value or state, $derived should be used instead of $effect. If not familiar, try using $state and $derived first to solve the problem, as $effect should be the last resort.
