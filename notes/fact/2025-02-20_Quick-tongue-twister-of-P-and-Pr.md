# Quick tongue twister of P and Pr

"Peter `prefers` picking plump pretty peaches."

Above sentence is a tongue twister. Obviously key sounds here are P and Pr, as I would say as well.

They're a little bit more difficult to say "Pr". The sound a bit more stress on what movements our mouth and lips need to do.

But you can see I've highlighted the word `prefers` here. That's very much going to be the key piece of vocab in this lesson, because we're looking a sharing preferences with `prefers`.

Preferences means the things we like. So we're going to focus on `prefers`. And we'll look at three grammatical structures for `prefer`. So, three different ways you can use it when sharing your opinions, your preferences, different things you like.
