# Present Continuous Tense

We use the present continuous when an action is happening now or happens often.

## I

Formula:
```py
I + am + V(ing) + Object
```
Examples:
```py
"I'm buying a pair of shoes."
#^^^ contraction of "I am", contraction is very important in spoken English more `native`

```


## You, We, They

Formula:
```py
You/We/They + are + V(ing) + Object 
```
Examples:
```py
"You are listening to the radio."
"Sally and David are making a sculpture."
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ because pronoun for two people is "they"
#                    so we use "are" instead of "is"

```

## He, She, It

Formula:
```py
He/She/It + is + V(ing) + Object
```
Examples:
```py
"She is working at a travel agent."
"The computer is making weird noises."
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ contraction is `computer's`, it's used nine times out of ten

```
```
