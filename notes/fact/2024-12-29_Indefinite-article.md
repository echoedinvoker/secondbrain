# Indefinite article

In front of **non-specific** noun. Unknown to speaker or listener.

```py
"He needs a car for his commute."
#         ^ means any car, not specific one

"She'll adopt a dog from the shelter."
#             ^ means any dog, not specific one, implied that she doesn't have a dog yet

"Let's buy an umbrella. It might rain."
#          ^^ means any umbrella, not specific one

```

Note that in the last example sentence above, we use "an" instead of "a". We will explain why in the next topic.
