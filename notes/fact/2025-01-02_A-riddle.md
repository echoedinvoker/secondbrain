# A riddle

```py
"There are 30 cows in a field and 28 chickens. How many didn't?"
```




























































The answer is 10. "28 chickens" can be written as "twenty ate chickens".

```py
"There are 30 cows in a field and 28 chickens. How many didn't?"
#                                 ^^

"There are 30 cows in a field and 20 ate chickens. How many didn't?"
#                                 ^^^^^^ they are the same of sound

```

Some different words can sound the same. We call it **homophones**. 

There are two other similar word type called **homonyms** and **homographs**, we'll talk about them later.
