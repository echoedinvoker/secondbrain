# Past perfect continuous

We use the past perfect continuous to discuss an **ongoing** past event that **continued to** another event in the past.

So still discussing two past events or actions, but one kept happening until the other happened.

**Positive**
Formula:
```py
Subject + had + been + Verb-ing
```
Examples:
```py
"She had been exercising before she rested."
# So she kept exercising until she rested.

"The car was wet because it had been raining."
# Past perfect continuous can also be the end of a cause.
# But I don't understand why the car was wet because it had been raining...

```

**Negative**
Formula:
```py
Subject + hadn't + been + Verb-ing
```
Examples:
```py
"I hadn't been studying before I took my test."
# So I wasn't studying until I took my test. (not a clever move...)

```
```
