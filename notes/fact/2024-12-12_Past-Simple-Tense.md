# Past Simple Tense

We use the past simple to talk about actions in the past that are **already complete**.

**positive:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + Verb (V2) + Object
```
Examples:
```py
"He listened to spotify this morning."

"We jumped over the wall."

```

**negative:**

Formula:
```py
Subject + didn't + Verb (V1) + Object
#                        ^^ be careful, this is V1 not V2 as above
```
Examples:
```py
"He didn't listen to spotify this morning."
#          ^^^^^^ not listened(V2) but listen(V1), be careful!

"I didn't call my auntie on the phone."

```
