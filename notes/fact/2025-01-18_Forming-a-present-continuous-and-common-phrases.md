# Forming a present continuous and common phrases

## Forming a present continuous

```py
Subject + is/am/are + verb-ing

# Examples

"I'm studying English."

"They're watching TV."

```

## Common phrases in introduction or greeting

```py
"Where are you [verb-ing] thesedays?"
# which means presently right now, [verb-ing] can be replaced with studying, working, living, etc.
# This structure is quite friendly and polite.

```

Generally within introductions, especially if it's an event such as a party, you might hear:

```py
"Are you having a good time?"

```
Then, you can respond with:

```py
"Yes, I'm having a great time, thanks."
#                  ^^^^^ you can replace this with any other adjective to describe your time.
#                        such as "good", "wonderful", "fantastic", or even "Ok" and "terrible" if you're not having a good time.
# But even you reply with "Ok" or "terrible", the structure of this sentence is still very friendly and polite.

```
