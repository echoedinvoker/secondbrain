# Contrasting connectives

- whereas
- instead of
- or
- otherwise
- unlike
- on the other hand

We use "contrasting" connectives to show ideas that are very different.

For example:o

```py
"I'll probably not go out if it rains although my friends often twist my arm in the end."
#                                     ^^^^^^^^                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ means '說服'
```
