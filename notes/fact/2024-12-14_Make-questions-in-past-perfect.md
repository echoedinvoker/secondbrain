# Make questions in past perfect

![q-past-perfect.png](../assets/imgs/q-past-perfect.png)

For example:
```py
"What had he eaten before he went to bed?"

"Why had she gone to work so early?"
# this sentence only ONE action but we still use past perfect
# that's because it's implied that there's a reason for the action
# So we can think it as:
#   "Why had she gone to work before she needed to ..."  (which is two actions now)

```
