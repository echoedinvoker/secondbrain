# Buzzing

We can use it to describe atmosphere, the feeling of an event, and it basically is used to describe an atmosphere or an event that there is some excitement, you can feel the tension.

You can even use it to describe towns or cities as well, towns or cities that are quite busy, that have a quite active community.

- Where the seaside town, although small, has a real buzzing atmosphere on the weekend markets.

- This rock concert is buzzing, everyone is excited and the atmosphere is electric.
