# Countable vs Uncountale Nouns

**Countable**
Individual people, places, animals, things or ideas.

**Uncountable**
Not individual objects - feelings, liquids, mass nouns.

mass nouns means nouns that cannot be counted. They usually represent:
- substances or materials: e.g. water, air, gold
- abstract concepts: e.g. information, advice, knowledge
- collective concepts: e.g. furniture, luggage


For example:
- Here is _some_ milk.
- There is _very little_ milk in the fridge.
- Here we have _some_ colored pencils.
- Helen bought _lots of_ colored pencils.
 
 Milk is liquid, so it is an uncountable noun. Colored pencils are countable, so they are countable nouns.

 Quantifier _some_ and _lots of_ can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns. However, _very little_ is used only with uncountable nouns.
