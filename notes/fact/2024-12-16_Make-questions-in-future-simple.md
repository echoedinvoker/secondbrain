# Make questions in future simple

![q-future-simple.png](../assets/imgs/q-future-simple.png)

Examples:
```py
"Where will you travel this summer?"
# actual we ask about the future plans of the person

"Why won't you listen to me?"
#    ^^^^^ generally, if we use `won't` as negative, it does occasionally have a slightly frustrated or upset tone
```
