# Phrasal Verbs

**Phrasal verbs** are used by English speakers to explain actions (like to use a verb), They sound **very native** in their use. (in other hand, if you use it wrong, it sounds very weird...)

```py
Phrasal_verbs = verb + particle
#                      ^^^^^^^^ Adverb or Preposition

```
There are some examples of phrasal verbs:

```py
Back down # back is the verb and down is the particle(preposition)

Back around # back is the verb and around is the particle(preposition)
```

Below are some features of phrasal verbs:
