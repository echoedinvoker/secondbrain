# Collocations


## Very native sounding English

**Collocations** are words that are commonly put together in English. By accurately using collocations, you can sound much more fluent!

For examples:

go to sleep
go around
go down
go ~~fall~~ (even we can guess the meaning, but it's not common to use, so it sounds weird)


## Similar to phrasal verbs, but...

**Collocations** are very similar to [[2024-12-04_Phrasal-Verbs|phrasal verbs]], but collocations have a wider variety of [[2024-12-05_Groups-of-collocations|word types combinations]].

Some phrasal verbs you can said that they are also collocations, but not all collocations are phrasal verbs.
