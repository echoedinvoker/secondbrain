# Conjunctions: Used to link ideas and parts of speech

Although, because, therefore, and, so, furthermore

- "I don't want lunch *because* I'm not hungry." - connecting ideas (cause and effect)
- "There's a sale in town *so* I'll go shopping later." - connecting ideas (cause and effect)
- "*Although* it's raining I'll still go for a run." - connecting ideas (contrast)
- "You work two jobs *therefore* you're busy." - connecting ideas (cause and effect)

Conjunctions do not necessarily have to be in the middle.
