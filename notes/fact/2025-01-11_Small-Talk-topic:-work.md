# Small Talk topic: work + Job

Talking about work or asking about recent professional duties and events is also a common type of small talk.

It should be noted that although most people do not mind, some people may not like to talk about work. So before starting to talk about work, it is best to first confirm if the other party is willing to discuss work.


```py
"How's work been keeping you?"
# You can just ask "How's work?" or "How's the job?" as well.
# `been keeping you` is a colloquial way of asking how someone is doing.
# basically, it means "If you enjoy your job or not?"

"Any interesting projects in the pipeline?"
#                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ there is no "pipe" or "pipeline"
#                                         it just means "is ongoing or planned"

"How's the 9-to-5 treating you?"
#          ^^^^^^ this is an expression for a regular job with fixed hours

```
