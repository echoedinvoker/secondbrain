# Declarative sentences

Declarative sentences are statements that share **facts**, **opinions**, **ideas** or **thoughts**.

They generally end with a **full stop** when in writing.

```py
"The tickets are expensive."
#^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# subject    predicate, main verb is "are"

"I love playing golf."
#^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#^    predicate, main verb is "love"
#subject


"It's a great film for sure."
