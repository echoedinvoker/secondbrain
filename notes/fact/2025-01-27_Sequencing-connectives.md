# Sequencing connectives

We use "sequencing" connectives to describe processes and events in time or stage order.

Compared to other types of connectives, sequencing connectives are usually only used to describe the order and timing of events, and are not used to express causal relationships or other types of relationships.

- first
- second
- third
- next
- after
- meanwhile
- finally

**Example:**

```py
"First, I opened up the shop, and next I waited for an hour for the fruit delivery van."
#^^^^^                        ^^^^^^^^  
```
```py
"After I finished my homework, I went out to play."
#^^^^^
```
```py
"Meanwhile, my brother was watching TV."
#^^^^^^^^^
```
