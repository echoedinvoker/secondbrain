# Future perfect continuous

We use the future perfect continuous to discuss an **ongoing** future event that **continues to** another event in the future.

**Positive** 

Structure:
```py
Subject + will + have + been + Verb-ing
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^          ^^^^ can contract to `ben`
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^contract to `'ll` sound more native
```
Examples:
```py
"I will have been studying Spanish for 3 years."
# the other action is not mentioned in the sentence, maybe in previous conversation

"You'll have been living in London for 3 weeks by next Friday."

```

**Negative**

Structure:
```py
Subject + will not/won't + have + been + Verb-ing
#                  ^^^^^better always use `won't` for negative, which sound more native
```
Examples:
```py
"I won't have been working there for ages now."

"She won't have been eating meat for about 5 years now."

```
```
