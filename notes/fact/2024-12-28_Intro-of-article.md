# Intro of article

**What are articles?**

Articles are words like "the", "a", and "an" that come before nouns.
They help us define whether a noun is **specific** or **unspecific**.


**Specific Articles**

The image focuses on the specific article "the".
We use "the" when we are talking about something:
- We know (and the listener knows) about.
- We can see.
- Is unique in the context of our conversation.

Example:

```py
"I saw the storm on the horizon."
#      ^^^ ^^^^^ I can see the storm, so it isn't just any storm.
#      ^^^ use "the" because `storm` is unique in the context of our conversation.
```

**Unspecific

Just talking about any of these things!

```py
"I'd hate to lose a wallet!"
#                 ^ ^^^^^^ I don't care which wallet, just any wallet.
#                 ^ use "a" because `wallet` is unspecific.

```
