| Put | Put | Put |
| Hit | Hit | Hit |
| Bring | Brought | Brought |
| Find | Found | Found |

Some teachers also call these three forms of verbs as V1, V2, and V3 respectively. 


## Past participle form is used in any perfect tenses

The `past participle form` is used in **any perfect tenses**. For example, in present perfect tense, past perfect tense, future perfect tense, etc. 


## Where is V-ing (gerund) form?

In fact, V-ing is noun not verb. So it is not included in the verb forms. But it is also important in some tenses.
