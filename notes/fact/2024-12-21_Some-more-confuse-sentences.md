# Some more confuse sentences

We already know that a sentence is `subject` + `predicate`. But sometimes it's hard to distinguish between the two. Here are some examples:

## Two persons

```py
"David gave the cake to Mary."
#^^^^^                  ^^^^ there are two persons, who is subject?
# David is the subject because he taking the action `gave`
```

Remember, the subject is the one who is doing the action.


## No person

```py
"Put down the gun!"
#         ^^^^^^^ no person, only a thing `gun`, so it's the subject?
# No, the subject is `you` who is being asked to put down the gun.
```
**In imperative sentences**, or **orders**, sometimes have implied subjects because we all know who the subject is!
