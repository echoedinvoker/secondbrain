# Listening Test 1

Listen to the audio and answer the questions.

## Audio script

Stuart: So, James, how was your weekend then? Did you do anything fun or just relax like normal?

James: Well, actually Stuart it was kind of a special weekend.

Stuart: Seriously? Why was it a special weekend then?

James: To be honest, it was my birthday.

Stuart: Oh, I’m sorry, James! I completely forgot! I feel awful now.

James: You should, Stuart - it’s the same date every year you know - and I first met you over 15 years ago now!

Stuart: What can I say, I’m so sorry mate. I’ve really lost touch with my calendar. But, I guess it’s a good job I brought this birthday present for you anyway!

James: I can’t believe it! You mean you were joking about forgetting my birthday?

Stuart: How could I forget? It’s 3 days after my mum’s birthday so it’s tough to miss.

James: Well thank you very much Stuart. That’s really very kind of you. I actually thought that you really did forget my birthday then!

Stuart: Of course not! So what did you do on your birthday?

James: I went out with the family for a really nice dinner. It was a secret that my wife didn’t tell me about and even the kids knew we were going. I think they enjoyed hiding a secret from me more than anything. Have you heard of The Fishworks? It’s just in the city center near the Modern Art Gallery.

Stuart: Actually, yes. I heard the food there is awesome.

James: Certainly is. We had a seafood buffet with oysters, crab - all sorts of fresh seafood. The kids tried to eat some of it but they’re still a bit scared of eating some fish. There was a salad buffet with other options too so they ate a lot from there.

Stuart: Sounds like a good birthday meal. What was the bill like afterwards?

James: I thought you might ask! I was surprised as I thought it would be quite expensive. It generally has a reputation for being a bit fancy and overpriced, but in fact the food bill came to just over £100 for the four of us. Not bad I thought!

Stuart: That’s not cheap although not too expensive for a really good restaurant. Although, how much did you pay for the drinks?

James: Well, me and my wife had several wines actually. That came to another £50 or so. All in about £150. For a family meal at a great restaurant I thought it was quite reasonable. We won’t be going all the time though! My bank manager would not be happy with me.

Stuart: Strangely enough James, I also had some seafood this weekend.

James: Good to hear! It wasn’t the same place was it?

Stuart: Not at that price! My seafood experience was quite unlike yours. Have you heard of Sam’s Chip Shop?

James: You mean the fish and chips shop on the high street?

Stuart: That’s it. Not so high class and nowhere near as expensive. My bill came to £6.50 - a lot cheaper than yours!

James: Maybe I should have taken the family there instead. I certainly would have saved a few pennies!

Stuart: What’s it like inside The Fishworks? I think it must be quite nicely decorated.

James: Yeah, it’s pretty cool inside too. They have two floors of seating, with the back floor being slightly raised. In the middle of the restaurant is a piano which someone plays at times throughout the meal - pretty relaxing. But, I’d say the best thing is the live fish tanks. All around the seating areas are these huge seawater fish tanks. They must be quite deep because some of the fish inside look massive! If you really feel like spending a lot of money, you can pick what fish to eat from the tanks. I thought I’d save my money for next year though!
