# Phrasal Verbs: Do


## Do without...

"I'll *do without* milk for two more days."

Basically means you'll be OK. You can still live, you won't complain too much without something.


## Do up...

"I can't wait to get cleaning and really *do up* our new home."

This is one of those phrasal verbs that we could replace for a synonym. And generally we could probably say do up is similar in meaning to *decorate*.


## Do away with...

"I heard that they're going to *do away with* CDs completely soon."

It means to abolish, to completely stop creating and using these things. So, if you do away with something, it becomes extinct, it becomes something that is not used anymore.


## Do well...

"I believe that to *do well* you need to work hard and be positive."

This phasal verb really does look quite like its meaning. And it's again, kind of could be replaced with a synonym and that would be *successful*.


## Do over...

"I'm getting a second chance and having a new *do over*."

It means to start again, to have another go at something.
