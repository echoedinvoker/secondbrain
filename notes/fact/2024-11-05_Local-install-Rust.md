# Local install Rust

To install Rust locally on your computer, follow the directions on this page:

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

After installation, restart your terminal then try running cargo --version. If you see a version print up then you're good to go! If you get an error then a little troubleshooting is in order.
