# Chalk and cheese

Use this phrase to describe two things that are completely different from each other.

- Me and my sister are like chalk and cheese. She's outgoing and I'm shy.

- The countryside in the UK is like chalk and cheese to inner city London or inner city Manchester. The countryside is peaceful and quiet, whereas the cities 
are noisy and busy.
