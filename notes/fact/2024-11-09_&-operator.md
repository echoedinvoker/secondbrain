# & operator

`&` will have different effects in different positions.

```rust
fn print_account(account: &Account) {
//                        ^ when put `&` before type, it means this argument
//                          should be a reference of that type value
    
    println!("{:#?}", account);
}

fn main() {
    let account = Account::new(1, String::from("Alice"));

    let account_ref = &account;
//                    ^ when put `&` before a value (precisely, a owner of a value),
//                      it `create` a reference of that value

    print_account(account_ref);
    println!("{:#?}", account);
}

```

In the above codes, we use `&` to create a reference of value, and bind it to a binding `account_ref`. However, in real projects, we usually omit this step and it becomes the following codes:

```rust
fn main() {
    let account = Account::new(1, String::from("Alice"));

    print_account(&account);
  //              ^ In real world, we usually use `&` directly in function call,
  //                you need to know that `&` here is actually creating a reference of `account` value

    println!("{:#?}", account);
}
```


## Read-only reference

One important thing is that when using a reference created with `&`, we cannot change the value, so it is READ-ONLY during the reference's lifetime. 

This feature allows us to automatically follow rule 3 of [[2024-11-07_Twelve-rules-of-writing-Rust-script|twelve rules]], [[2024-11-09_Analyze-rule-3-and-4-from-Rust-twelve-rules|here]] is the detailed explanation about the borrow checker.
