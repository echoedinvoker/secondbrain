# Make questions in past perfect continuous

![q-ppc.png](../assets/imgs/q-ppc.png)

For examples:

```py
"Why had she been lying to me?"
# you can see it as "Why had she been lying to me before I found out?"
# So it is still two actions in the past, but one of them is continuous to another action happened.

"Where had you been traveling before here?"
#^^^^^^^^^ if you want to sound more natural, you can contract "Where had" to "Where'd"
# The first sentence is the same. You can consider to contract "Why had" to "Why'd" as well.

```
