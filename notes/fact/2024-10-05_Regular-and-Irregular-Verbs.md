# Regular and Irregular Verbs

Verbs can be put into two main groups, regular verbs and irregular verbs.

## Regular Verbs

- Follow a fixed pattern

Add -d, -ed, -ied to past tense forms: Cooked, jumped, piled, studied.

## Irregular Verbs

- No fixed pattern.

Simply put, you will need to memorise how the verbs changes into past tense and past participle form.
