# Contractions


Contractions are used by English speakers to **speed up** their communication and make **sounding words easier**.

And it's also makes the language more **informal**.

```py
"The swimming pool's freezing today!"
#             ^^^^^^ contraction of "pool is"

"This book isn't very interesting."
#          ^^^^^ contraction of "is not"

"My friend doesn't like football."
#          ^^^^^^^ contraction of "does not"
```

```
