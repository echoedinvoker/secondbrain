# Flow Engineering


## What is Flow Engineering?

`Flow Engineering` is a systematic and strategic approach for developing software that will incorporate AI driven decision making processes.


## Goal of Flow Engineering

The essential goal of `Flow engineering` is to manage and optimize how AI systems with LLM handle tasks by defining a clear flow or a sequence of operations.

So we don't want the AI to start going and creating some imaginary tasks and start executing them. However, we want to define a clear flow, and we want LLM to stay within that flow.

And there are still decisions that LLM could make, for example, determining if the output is ready to be released and if it's a good enough solution, or to which step now to take.


## How does Flow look like?

These flows are not merely linear, so they may involve complex decision making nodes where the AI may generate multiple outputs, which are often assessed and refined in an iterative cycle.


## Flow Engineering mimic human development processes

`Flow Engineering` aims to incorporate **systematic planning** and **testing phase** that mimic human development processes, and all of this to enhance reliability and functionality of AI generated solutions.


## The work distribution when developing AI software in near future

- 60% Flow Engineering
- 35% Fine Tuning
- 5% Prompt Engineering
