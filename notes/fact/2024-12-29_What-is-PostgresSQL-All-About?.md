# What is PostgresSQL All About?


We use databases to store information. Put it inside of a database where it gets persisted in either memory or on hard disk.

And then eventually, we can retrieve that information at some future point in time.

We are going to connect to a database using a client. The client can be any piece of software that can communicate with the database such as a web server, a desktop application, or a mobile application etc.

We use SQL to tell the database what we want to do. SQL is a language that is used to interact with generic databases. It is a standard language that is used across all databases. So, if you know SQL, you can interact with any database.
