# Nodes inheritation

Nodes can inherit properties and funcaionalities from their parent nodes. Just like classes in object-oriented programming,

When we check the document of a node, we can see the chain of inheritance.

This method is also used to show inheritance in the Node's attributes UI.

> So if we want to make the Area2D node move, we should [[2024-10-12_Check-document|refer to the documentation]]  for Node2D, not the documentation for Area2D.


```
