For example:
```py
"Where do you live?"

"What time does the bus leave?"
#  ^    ^
#  ^    noun
#  ^
#  question word
```

The second example, `What` is **Interrogative Adjectives** we mentioned in [[2024-12-03_Five-different-groups-of-Adjectives|this topic]]. It also fits the formula for making questions in the present simple tense.

About [[2024-12-08_The-third-person-singular|the third person singular]] issue, auxiliary verbs `do/does` also need to follow the third person singular rule, but the main verb does not need to change.
