# Definite and indefinite article

In [[2024-12-28_Intro-of-article|this topic]], we know that articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific.

So there are two types of articles: `definite` and `indefinite`. They help us define whether a noun is specific or unspecific.


## Definite Article: "The"

Used with a **specific** noun.

The speaker and listener **both** know about this particular noun.

Example:
```py
"I saw the cat in the garden."
#      ^^^^^^^
#Here, "the cat" is specific. The speaker is referring to a particular cat that both the speaker and listener are familiar with.

```


## Indefinite Articles: "A" or "An"

Used with a **non-specific** noun.

The noun is **unknown** to **either** the speaker or the listener.

Example:
```py
"I'm looking for a book to read."
#                ^^^^^^
# Here, "a book" is non-specific. The speaker is looking for any book, not a particular one.

```


In a nutshell:

Definite articles like "the" point to a specific noun.
Indefinite articles like "a" or "an" refer to any noun from a general category.
