# Demonstratives

Demonstratives are words we use to point out things (add stress or focus) or show what we're talking about.

Demonstratives also define both **distance** and **numbers**.

There are four main demonstratives:

* **This:** Points to something near you... "I like this book."
* **That:** Points to something farther away... "Look at that tree."
* **These:** Multiple things near you... "I have these pens."
* **Those:** Multiple things further away... "I see those birds."
