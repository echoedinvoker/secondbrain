# Price action confirmation in pullback

When ONE of the condition of any [[2025-04-04_Pullback-standard|pullback standard pattern]] is not met (other conditions are met), we need to wait for price action confirmation appear, then we can consider the pullback is valid.


## definition of price action confirmation

Within 4 candles on the right side of the failed pullback standard pattern, at least one normal or marubuzu candle must appear and its close price must be higher than the highest price of the failed pullback standard pattern.


## Reason

When the pullback standard pattern fails, it indicates that there is no consistent power in the pullback direction, and often leads to oscillation. If within four candles, one candle is a marubozu or normal candle and closes above the highest price of the pullback standard pattern, it implies that the brief tug-of-war between bulls and bears has ended, and power continues to move in the direction of the pullback. At this point, it can be considered that this pullback is valid.
