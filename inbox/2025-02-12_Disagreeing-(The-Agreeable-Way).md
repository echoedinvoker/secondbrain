# Disagreeing (The Agreeable Way)

## Active Listening:

 Listen attentively without interrupting, showing respect for the other person's perspective.


## "I" Statements:

Express disagreement using "I" statements to avoid blame and keep the focus on your viewpoint.

If you disagree with someone, say I, I feel, I think, I believe because it makes it less like you're pointing your finger and you're accusing that word.


## Find Common Ground:

Identify shared values or agreements to create a positive atmosphere.
