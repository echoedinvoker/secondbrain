# Example of compound sentence

A compound sentence is a sentence that has at least two independent clauses joined by a connectives such as "and," "but," or "or."

"I really love playing the piano *and* I'd also really love to play the drums, too!"

"My father's a very kind man *although* he works way too hard!"

Connective `although` is used to show a slight contrast between the two independent clauses.
