When you see this, you can refer to near demand/supply zone.

If there is no near demand/supply zone, you can draw the zone from the middle of the second candle (body?) to the lowest/highest price of waves.

This case is the most powerful among all cases because it represents that there are already many buyers/sellers waiting to trade in this zone.

## Examples
