# Archievements: Using the Past Tense

As our achievements are in the past, it make sense to use the *past tense* in order to describe them.

"During my vacation last summer, I *explored* a beautiful island. I *hiked* in the countryside and *met* some great people."

"In school, I *volunteered* for a community project. I *organized* events, *collaborated* with locals, and *contributed* to positive changes."
