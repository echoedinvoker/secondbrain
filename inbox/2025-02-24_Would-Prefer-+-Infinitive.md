# Would Prefer + Infinitive

This is another type of structure here with prefer. `I would` the `would` here really shows intent, future desires.

Infinitive is a type of verb like `to run`, `to eat`, `to sleep`. It's the base form of the verb.

- I **would prefer** `to travel` business class.

In speech, commonly contracted to `I'd prefer to travel business class.`, or it sounds a bit too formal.


- **I'd prefer** `to start early` if possible.

- **I'd prefer** `to cancel` the meeting.

- **I'd prefer** `to pick peaches` tomorrow.
