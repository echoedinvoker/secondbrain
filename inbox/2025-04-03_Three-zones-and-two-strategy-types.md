# Three zones and two strategy types

## Three zones
According to the position where the new key level appears, we can define three zones:

**Re-test recent high (Break & re-test strategy - BRT zone)**
When the price breaks through recent highs (or recent lows) with a very strong force, causing the pullback wave to only reach the high (or low) that was broken, the key level area is called the BRT zone.

**Smart money concepts - POI zone**
When the price breaks through the recent high (or low) but the momentum is not as strong as before, causing a pullback wave to reach a key level between the recent high (or low) that was broken, forming a new key level, this key level area is called the POI zone.

**Key level strategy -CKL zone**
When the pullback wave returns to the previous key level and stops, then continues to create a new high (or low), this key level area is called the CKL zone.


## Two strategy types

**Confluence strategy**
According to the entry into the three zones above, following the direction of the main trend is called a confluence strategy.

**Unconfluence strategy (UKL)**
Entering the market during a pullback wave and implementing a strategy in the opposite direction of the main trend is called an unconfluence strategy.

The Unconfluence strategy requires a greater amount of knowledge in order to be successful, as it requires a deeper understanding of market operations.


## Conclusion
We are currently familiar with the key level strategy in the confluence strategy. Next, we will learn more knowledge to be able to utilize the other two zones for trading strategies, and even be able to implement an unconfluence strategy.
