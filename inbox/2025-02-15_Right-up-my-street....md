# Right up my street...

There's no street involved actually. This is an idiom, but it means that this is something that we really like. It's something that matches our interests.

- The new TV is right up my street. I love the design and the features.

- My new car is right up my street. Air conditioning, leather seats, power steering and everything else is included within it!
