# Dive into three of contrasting phrases

**In contracst to**

- **In contrast to** Thailand, the sun isn't as strong in the UK.
- The sun in the UK isn't as strong, **in contrast to** Thailand.

You can open the conversation with this phrase or put it in the end of the sentence.

Instead of simply using "but" or "however," "in contrast to" is more formal and emphasizes the contrast.


**Dissimilar**

- Horror movies are **dissimilar** to romantic comedies.
- The two paintings are **dissimilar** in style.


"Dissimilar" is primarily used as an adjective.

Use "dissimilar" with "to" to compare two things that are different from each other. While using "dissimilar" alone, you can follow it with "in" to describe how two things are different from each other.

"Disimilar" is a more formal way to say "different" or "unlike." It is often used in academic or professional contexts to emphasize the differences between two things.


**Unalike**

- Dogs are so **unalike to** cats, they are so different. (not common)
- Dogs and cats are **unalike** in many ways.

It is the **antonym of "alike"**.

"Unalike" usually emphasizes **clear, comprehensive differences**.In the first example sentence, the use of **"so unalike"** further strengthens this emphasis.

It emphasizes **overall** differences or dissimilarities.

"Unalike" falls in formality between "different" and "dissimilar", but is less common than "different".

Although the usage of **unalike to** appears in your example sentence, this usage is relatively uncommon. It is more common to simply say **unalike** or use **unalike in**.
