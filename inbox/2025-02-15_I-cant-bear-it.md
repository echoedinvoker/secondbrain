# I cant bear it

Of course, there's no grizzly bear involved. It basically is more connected to patients or waiting for something. It implies that you hate or dislike something or someone.

And you can replace pronouns "I" with other.


- The rush hour traffic on Friday. I can't bear it!

- My boss at work. I can't bear him! I can't stand to be around him.
