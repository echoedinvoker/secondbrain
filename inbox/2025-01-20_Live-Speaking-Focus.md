# Live Speaking Focus

**How's it going?**

Like "How are you?" but more casual.


**Long time no see!**


**I've been well, thanks/thank you.**

If you feel "I'm fine, thank you" is too boring or traditional, you can use this instead.


**It's been way too long.**

Kind of like to say "Long time no see", but more formal.


**See ya, later.**

To close a conversation, or leave a group, you can use it. It's a friendly, polite way but not so formal.
