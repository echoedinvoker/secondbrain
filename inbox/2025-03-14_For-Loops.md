# For Loops

```lua
message = 0

for i=1, 3, 1 do -- iterator, last value, step
  message = message + 10
end
-- each times the codes between `do` and `end` are executed, the value of iterator is increased by the step value
-- when the iterator is equal to the last value, it'll execute the code one more time and then stop the loop

function love.draw()
  love.graphics.print(message)
  --                  ^^^^^^^ in this case, it'll print 30
end
```

We can even count down by using a negative step value:

```lua
message = 0

for i=5, 1, -1 do
--    ^     ^^ the iterator starts at 5 and decreases by 1 each time
  message = message + 10
end

function love.draw()
  love.graphics.print(message)
  --                  ^^^^^^^ in this case, it'll print 50
end
```

We can use the iterator in the codes between `do` and `end`:

```lua
message = 0

for i=1, 3, 1 do
  message = message + i
  --                  ^ using the iterator, the value of message will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
end
```

As a developer, when using a for loop, pay special attention to the starting value, ending value, and step value of the iterator to avoid causing an infinite loop situation.
