# Pet hate

It's used when talking about something you enjoy hating, or something that like disliking.

A pet-hate is something that you don't like, but in a strange way, it actually feels satisfying.

- Classical music is real pet-hate for me. I enjoy not liking it. I actually find it irritating and I like discussing that.
