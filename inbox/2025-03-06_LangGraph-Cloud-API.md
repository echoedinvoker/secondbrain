# LangGraph Cloud API


## Dependencies
```sh
pipenv install "langgraph-cli[inmem]" python-dotenv
```
and *Docker* *Docker Compose* installed and running.


## Check the command `langgraph`
```sh
 langgraph --help
Usage: langgraph [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build       📦 Build LangGraph API server Docker image.
  dev         🏃 Run LangGraph API server in development mode with...
  dockerfile  🐳 Generate a Dockerfile for the LangGraph API server, with...
  new         🌱 Create a new LangGraph project from a template.
  up          🚀 Launch LangGraph API server.

```

Basically, we can just run `langgraph up` and it'll pull the image and run the container for us.

`langgraph up` will occur some errors about `python-dotenv` not installed, it's hard to resolve it because we need to install `python-dotenv` in the container, we can directly run `langgraph dev` to run the server in development mode without any errors.

> I speculate that `langgraph up` must be used with a poetry project in order to work properly, because the Dockerfile generated by `langgraph dockerfile ./Dockerfile` contains references to the `/deps/` folder, which should only exist in a poetry project.


## Instead of LangGraph Studio, LangGraph API Server is also powerful!
```sh
 langgraph dev
INFO:langgraph_api.cli:

In previous topics, we experienced how to use LangChain Studio to develop our application, but `langgraph dev` also provides an API server, which offers many APIs generated based on the graph of our project.

Our graph ultimately needs to be presented by the front end, and this API server exists for this purpose. They will greatly simplify the development process of communication between our backend AI graph and the front end. We'll start to explore the APIs in the next topic.
