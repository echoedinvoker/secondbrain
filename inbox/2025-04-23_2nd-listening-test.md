# 2nd listening test

Store Assistant: Hello there. Is there anything I can help you with today?

Lady: I’m shopping for household items for my new home.

SA: Excellent. I’m sure I can help you with that. What were you looking for?

Lady: Quite a lot of things really! I’ve just bought and moved into a new town house. It’s kinda run down so needs a lot of things buying to decorate it and make it look nice again.

SA: I see. So you’re looking for general household items or pretty much everything for a full refurbishment?

Lady: The house is pretty much an empty shell. The only thing I have in there right now is a bed that I brought from my last home. I think we could be here shopping for quite some time! Sorry to bother you!

SA: Not at all! That’s my job and I’m happy to help. What is your new home like?

Lady: Well, as I said, it’s a standard townhouse with 3 bedrooms, separate kitchen and living room and one bathroom. There’s a small garden to the back as well but maybe I’ll think about fixing that later next year. For now, I’m mainly looking to buy household items for the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms.

SA: Okay. What do you plan to do with the third bedroom?

Lady: I think I’ll make it my office as I sometimes work from home. For my home office, I’ll just be needing a desk, comfortable seat and some storage equipment.

SA: We certainly have a lot of shopping to do! If you don’t mind me asking, what is your estimated budget?

Lady: Probably around £15,000 for now. Of course, less than this would be good but let’s see! I don’t really have a clue about how much it will cost. I think today is useful to just have a look around and then I can think more carefully about budget and spending limits.

SA: A good idea. Where shall we start then? Home electronics are just over there. Shall we take a look at SMART TVs for your living room?

Lady: Perfect! That’s one of the main things I will be needing first. I’m addicted to Netflix!

SA: Okay, here is our top of the range Samsung TV. It’s a brand new model and features all the latest technology including a curved screen.

Lady: It looks really nice. Is this a 50” inch TV?

SA: It’s actually a 55” TV and you’ll be pleased to know this currently has an 20% discount.

Lady: This sounds very promising. But actually I’d rather just buy a flat screen TV. I heard some bad reviews about curved ones and they tend to be a bit overpriced. What do you think?

SA: I suppose you’re right that curved TVs have split opinions - although I do really like them! Let’s take a look at the TVs over here then.

Lady: Okay. I’m also looking for a 3 piece sofa for my living room as well. Would it be possible to take a look at that after we’ve seen some TVs?

SA: That won’t be a problem as living room furniture and appliances are just next to this section of the department store.

Lady: I don’t suppose I could borrow some paper and a pen? I forgot mine at home. Maybe I could take some notes on different things we’ve seen and write the prices down. That way I can come to a good estimate of total cost by the end of the day.

SA: Certainly. Here take my pen and use this notepad.

Lady: Thank you very much, that’s really kind of you.
