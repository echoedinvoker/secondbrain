# Present Perfect

The *result of an event now* that happened sometime in the past.

Subject + has/have + past participle

`has/have` is the auxiliary verb, and `past participle` is the main verb such as `eaten`, `gone`, `seen`, etc.

"*I have owned the same TV* for years."

We focus on the result of the event, not the event itself or the time it happened.

"*We haven't swarm* for ages."

So they still haven't swum. The focus is on the result of the event, not the event itself or the time it happened.
