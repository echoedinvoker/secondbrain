# More examples of past perfect and present perfect continuous

## Past Perfect Continuous
An event started and finished in the past.

Subject + had + been + verb(ing)

"We had been playing board games till late at night."

"I had been living in London from 2010 to 2015."


## Present Perfect Continuous
An event started in the past and ongoing now.

Subject + has/have + been + verb(ing)

"They have been waiting for the stores to open up."

"We haven't been hanging out much recently."



We really interested on the duration and process of the actions. So we use the present perfect continuous and past perfect continuous to express that.
