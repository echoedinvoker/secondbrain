# In

`In` is used for location, color, shape and liquids, too. But it also quite specifically used for discussing things being withinside another objects, edges as well as location.


"Big Ben is in London."

We can think of London as having edges to its zone and Big Ben is, of course, inside those edges.


We can also use it for edges we can see.

"My coffee is in my mug."

My coffee is inside my mug.
