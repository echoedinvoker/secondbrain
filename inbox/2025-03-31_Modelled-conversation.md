# Modelled conversation

## Script

(Telephone dial tone)
Alan: Hello, thanks for calling Super Lettings, you’re speaking to Alan, how may I help you?
Jenny: Ah, hello, thanks for answering Alan. My name’s Jenny. Ah… I’m calling to enquire
about renting a flat or some accommodation from you?
Alan: Well, you’ve called the right place. We always aim to provide the best service possible.
Jenny: That’s good to hear!
Alan: What sort of budget and area were you thinking, Jenny?
Jenny: Well, I’m not completely sure… I suppose I have around £445 per month. If I can find
something a little cheaper that would be great! Ideally, somewhere around South Newton would
be great.
Alan: Okay, I think we may have a few listings. Are you looking for shared accommodation or
wanting to live alone?
Jenny: Let me think... If you have something in budget that is a one bedroom, that would be
amazing.
Alan: Yes, we have a few studios that would fit your needs.
Jenny: Excellent. I’d love my own space. Sharing flats can really stress me out sometimes!
South Newton would be best as I generally take the train to college from there.
Alan: Okay, let’s see what we can do. Are there any other features you’d be looking for?
Jenny: Well, just try and show me decent listings please. The last agent I met didn’t have a
clue! They showed me all sorts of run down buildings that were completely overpriced!
Alan: No problem! I’ll try my best not to waste your time!
Jenny: Great, how about 3pm tomorrow afternoon?
Alan: That sounds perfect.
Jenny: Thanks again Alan, and see you tomorrow!
