# Publishing Your App

After preparing the signed APK, you can publish your app to the Google Play Store.

To publish your app, you need to go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/signup).

Then you will go through a sign-up process, and finally you will need to pay a one-time fee of $25. After that, you can publish your app an unlimited number of times.
