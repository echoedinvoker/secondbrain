# Im (Were) Game

It's a very colloquial idiom which you can use when talking about trying new activities, or it can also be used when someone requests that you do something or do something together.

That's basically means is that we'll give it a go. We can do it.

"Do you want to join our five a side football team?" "Yeah, I'm game, let's do it."
