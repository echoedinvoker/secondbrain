# Break out standard

Break out standard can be applied in any zones, places, to determine if there is a valid break out.


## When to use break out standard

### Key level Confirmation

In order to confirm whether the Key level exists, the following conditions need to be checked:
- pullback is valid by using pullback standard
- break out recent high (or low) is valid by using break out standard


### Break out Key level

When the Key level is broken, it represents a change in trend. We also need to use break out standards to confirm whether this Key level has been effectively broken. If it does not meet the break out standard, the trend is likely to continue in its original direction.


### Break out POI zone

POI zone is a zone of the banks, of the funds try to join the markets very strongly. And here also one of the zone you will look for entry at NCI trading system.

We also need to confirm whether this POI zone has been effectively broken out according to the standard.


### Range

In the NCI trading system, `range` is the same meaning as `sideways`, which means the price is moving up and down in a range. And we normally don't trade and analyze right over here because buying and selling pressure is not clearly. We just need to wait for the price to break out of the range then try to join the market. We also need to confirm whether this range has been effectively broken out according to the standard.


## Terminology

### Break out line (BOI)

BOI is a key point used to determine whether a Breakout is valid, such as the high and low points of a range, the high and low points of a key level zone, or recent high and low points and so on.
