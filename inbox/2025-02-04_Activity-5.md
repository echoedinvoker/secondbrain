# Activity 5

Use the 6 Ws (What, Where, When, How, Why, Who) to plan a short speech on an important event in your life.

Example:
My first day at school was a memorable event in my life. It was a sunny day in September. I was five years old. I was excited and a little scared. I was wearing a new dress and new shoes. My mother held my hand as we walked to school. I remember the smell of chalk and the sound of children laughing. I remember the teacher's smile and the way she helped me find my desk. I remember the taste of the apple my mother packed in my lunchbox. I remember feeling proud and happy when I came home that day. My first day at school was a special day because it was the beginning of a new adventure. It was the day I learned to read and write. It was the day I made new friends. It was the day I started to grow up. It was the day I began to discover the world. It was the day I began to discover myself. My first day at school was a day I will never forget.
