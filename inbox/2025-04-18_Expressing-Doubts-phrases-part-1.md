# Expressing Doubts phrases part 1

When we disagree with someone, we can express our doubts in a polite way. Here are some phrases we can use:

## Not so sure about that

"Not so sure about that to be honest. Something just doesn't sound right to me."

## A bit iffy

It means something is dodgy or untrustworthy.

"That website looked a bit iffy. Looked more like it was some sort of phishing scam to me."

(Phishing scam: a scam to get personal informations)


## Wouldn't bet on it

"He reckons he'll pass first time? Wouldn't bet on it with how little he's studied."


## Sounds a bit dodgy

"It all sounds a bit dodgy to me. Did you check if the company's even legit?"
