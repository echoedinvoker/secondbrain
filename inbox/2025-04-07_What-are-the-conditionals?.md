# What are the conditionals?

The three conditionals are used to discuss and speculate about hypothetical events (things that didn't happen!)

> *hypothetical* - it can be used as a noun for something that didn't happen. It might happen, it just didn't happen yet.

**First conditional**
"If the tickets are on sale I will definitely order two or three"
 ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Second conditional**
"If I got the job I would work really hard to movce up the company"
 ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Third conditional**
"If you had emailed me earlier, we wouldn't have missed the deadline."
 ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Each conditional has `if`, it's the magic word. It's super important for whatever conditional we use.
