# Describing and Talking About Your Archievements

We can use *past tense* or *present perfect* to talk about our achievements.

The difference between *past tense* and *present perfect* is that *past tense* is used to talk about a specific time in the past, while *present perfect* is used to talk about an unspecified time in the past.
