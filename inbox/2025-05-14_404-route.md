# 404 route

When the user enters a URL that does not exist, we need to route to a 404 page. This is a common requirement in web applications. In Vue Router, we can achieve this by defining a catch-all route that matches any path that does not match any of the defined routes.

We can use regex to match any path in the dynamic route parameter, so that we can match this route even without a specific route.

```ts
// other routes should be defined before this route...

{
    path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*',
    //      ^^^^^^^^^^ any parameter
    //                ^^^^ . means any character, * means 0 or more times
    //                    ^ * means this rule is repeatable (or we can said it optional because it turns it into array, for example: /a/b/c will be ['a', 'b', 'c'])
    //                      this is useful when we want to route to NotFoundView programmatically (maybe fetch data failed)
    name: 'not-found',
    component: NotFoundView,
}
```

In addition to routing to the 404 page, there are other functions that can be used in the path using regex. You can refer to the official documentation [docs](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/route-matching-syntax#Repeatable-params) for more information.
