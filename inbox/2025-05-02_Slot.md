# Slot

```vue
<!--Parent.vue-->
<template>
  <Button label="Register" />
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import Button from '@/components/Button.vue';
</script>
```

```vue
<!--Button.vue-->
<template>
  <button>{{ label }}</button>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps({
  label: String,
})
</script>
```

Above, you can see that the props passed from parent to child are being used between the markup button open tag and close tag. Usually, in this position, we would directly use slot technology to allow the child to directly use the values from the parent, and also to directly pass in HTML. Overall, this approach is more flexible and much simpler.

```vue
<!--Parent.vue-->
<template>
  <Button>
    <span>Register</span> <!-- the HTML between the Button open tag and close tag is passed to the <slot /> of Button.vue -->
  </Button>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import Button from '@/components/Button.vue';
</script>
```


````vue
<!--Button.vue-->
<template>
  <button>
    <slot /> <!-- This is the slot, which is the placeholder for the parent to pass in HTML -->
  </button>
</template>

<!--No need to props anymore-->
```

You can see from the above example, the child directly uses the HTML written in the parent, so props are not needed.

For more clearer understanding, let's create a state in the parent component and pass it to the child component by using slot technology.

```vue
<!--Parent.vue-->
<template>
  <Button>
    <span>{{ title }}</span>
  </Button>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import Button from '@/components/Button.vue';

const title = ref('Register');
</script>
```

````vue
<!--Button.vue-->
<template>
  <button>
    <slot />
  </button>
</template>
```

It still works because the child component can access the parent component's state through the slot directly.
