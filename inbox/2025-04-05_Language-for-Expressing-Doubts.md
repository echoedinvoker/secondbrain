# Language for Expressing Doubts

Here's 4 key expressions you can use for **expressing uncertainty**.

"I'm not entirely convinced that the current strategy will yield the desired results."

> "I have reservations about..."

`skeptical` means there's somethings you disagree with, but it's saying it in a more soft, polite way.

This idiom means that something is uncertain or undecided. There's some doubt about it.
