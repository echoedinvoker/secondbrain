# Entry, Stoploss, Take profit

- Our entry direction must always follow the direction of the trend.

- Key level should be an area rather than simply a recent low or high point. For example, the low point of an up key level should be slightly lower than the recent low point, and the high point can be judged based on the proportion of the chart. It should have an appropriate thickness to allow some noise.

- The entry point should be set at the high point of the up key level and the low point of the down key level.

- The stop loss should be set at a low point on the up key level, and conversely at a high point on the down key level.

- If the profit-taking point is in an uptrend, it should be drawn in an area below the recent high where profits can be taken, conversely, in a downtrend, it should be drawn in an area above the recent low where profits can be taken.

- Whether it is a key level or a recent high/low, it should be a range rather than a single point, because the market has many errors, and there is also the possibility of false breakouts and breakdowns. However, this range should not be too large, it must be balanced with the space where we can profit. This way, our stop loss will not be too large, and our profit space will be large enough, so that our trades can be profitable.
