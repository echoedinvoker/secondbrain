# Create a minimun Love2D project and run it with Love2D

```sh
mkdir my_love_game # Create a directory for the project
cd my_love_game
touch main.lua # entry point must be named `main.lua`
love . # Run the game, it'll find the main.lua file and run it

```
Then you will see a black window, which is your game. Because there is no content in main.lua yet, it will only be a black window.
