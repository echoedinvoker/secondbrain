# Trend?

**Uptrend**
When the price breaks through the recent high point, we can say that the price is rising.

**Downtrend**
When the price breaks through the recent low point, we can say that the price is falling.

**Skip noise**
We only focus on the obvious high points and low points in that time frame, and do not need to pay attention to the small high points and low points. These noises will affect our judgment.
