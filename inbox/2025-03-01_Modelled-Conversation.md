# Modelled Conversation

## Script

David: Before we begin our lesson on daily routines, I’d like everyone to say a big welcome to our new student, Grace. Welcome to our English class, Grace.

Grace: Thanks so much for letting me join - I can’t wait to start.

David: Maybe you could start with telling us about your daily routine?

Grace: Sure, of course! Well, I kinda guess my daily routine is quite run of the mill really. I usually wake up at around 6:50am or 7:00 in the morning and then brush my teeth and take a shower. Most days, I tend to skip breakfast although I heard this is quite unhealthy, right?

David: I heard that’s true, Grace!

Grace: Well, I suppose I shouldn’t skip that bit! After that, I get dressed then do my make up and things, but try not to spend too long on this! After that, I oughta get out of the house. I try to be on the train and set off to work at around 8:15. Generally speaking, I’m at work for about 8:50 or 9 if the train’s delayed.

David: And I’m sure that happens often around here!

Grace: It really does! After work, I like to hang out with friends in the evening or just take my dog for a walk and watch a movie. Pretty chilled really.

David: How about the weekends, Grace?

Grace: Actually, I sometimes have to work overtime on weekends, but if I’m free I’ll take it easy and sleep in!

David: Sounds perfect!
