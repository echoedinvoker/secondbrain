# Compound vs complex

Compound and complex sentences are mde using different varieties of clauses.


## Compund sentence

Two independent clauses joined with connectives like and, but, or, so, yet, for, nor.

"My favourite past times are writing *and* I also enjoy making videos."

Here, we use `and` to join the two independent clauses together to show that they are related.

Here, we use `but` to show contrast between the two independent clauses.


## Complex sentence

1 independent clause and 1 dependent clause joined with comma (,)

"My favourite past times is writing, when I get the chance anyway!"

"When summer arrives, I'm camping up in the national parks."
