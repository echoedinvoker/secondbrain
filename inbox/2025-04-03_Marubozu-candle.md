# Marubozu candle

## Definition

A Marubozu candle is a candle where the body occupies more than 70% of the length of the candle.


## Story

![green-maru-candle.png](../assets/imgs/green-maru-candle.png)
The above image shows a rising Marubozu candle. After opening, there was a slight selling pressure that caused the price to drop to the low. Then, a consistent buying pressure emerged, causing the price to rise from the low to the high. Afterwards, there was some slight selling pressure that caused the price to drop to the close.

The characteristic of a Marubozu candle is that it has consistent power and relatively weak reverse pressure, which is very helpful for the continuity of the market.
