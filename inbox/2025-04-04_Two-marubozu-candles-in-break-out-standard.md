# Two marubozu candles in break out standard

Condition is the same as [[2025-04-04_Pullback-standard:-Two-marubozu-candles|Pullback standard: Two marubozu candles]], but one more condition is added:

The close points of the two marubozu candles must be higher (or lower) than the Break out line (BOI).

**We don't need** to check how many % body of the first marubozu candle closed above (or below) the BOI. Just need to make sure that the close points of the two marubozu candles are higher (or lower) than the BOI.
