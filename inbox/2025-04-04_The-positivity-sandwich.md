# The positivity sandwich

We should be careful when showing doubt, **especially when doubting a person's thinking**, as it could be seen as rude.

## The Positivity Sandwich

The Positivity Sandwich is a communication technique that helps express doubts or concerns in a compassionate way.

### Structure:
1. **Begin with positive statement first!**
2. Then, **express your doubts/reservations**.
3. Finally, **say another positive statement**.

### Example 1 - Work Context:
- **Starting Positively:** "I appreciate everyone's effort during the project; there have been some innovative ideas and hard work."
- **Presenting Doubt:** "However, I have some small reservations about our timelines, so we really need to discuss this more."
- **Ending Positively:** "Nevertheless, I believe that with our team's skill set and dedication, we can perform brilliantly this term."

### Example 2 - Personal Context:
- **Starting Positively:** "I've noticed how committed you are to your goals, and I think that's really fantastic Sarah."
- **Presenting Doubt:** "... But, I've got to be honest, I'm a bit worried that your workload is affecting your wellbeing."
- **Ending Positively:** "I know you're very resilient and hard working but let me know if you need help with anything!"

This approach helps maintain positive relationships while still communicating necessary concerns or doubts.
