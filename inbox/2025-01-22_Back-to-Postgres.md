# Back to Postgres

In [[2025-01-22_Designing-a-Follower-System|this topic]], we've written the last table into our design schema tool.

Next, we return to Postgres and proceed with the following steps.


**1. Create new database**


**2. Create tables**

The schema design tool may be able to directly output SQL script, but we choose to write it ourselves because we may need to add some constraints or validations.


**3. Insert data**

The lecturer will provide a script for this.


**4. Write some queries**

We'll write some queries that we may need to use on the Instagram app.


**5. Realize that a few things could have been designed better! Make some changes**

After step 4, we may discover some areas for improvement, where we will delve deeper into some of the features of Postgres that can be used to enhance performance, scalability, and so on.
