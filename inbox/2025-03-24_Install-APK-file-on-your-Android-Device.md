# Install APK file on your Android Device

Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable, then drag and drop the APK file onto your device.

You can download any file manager app in the store, and then use it to find the APK file and install it.

There may be a security warning because this APK file is not from the store. To allow installation, please go to settings -> App & notifications -> advanced -> Special app access -> Install unknown apps -> choose your file manager -> allow installation of unknown applications.

Then, use the file manager to find the APK file and install it again.

Finally, you can run the game on your Android device for testing.
