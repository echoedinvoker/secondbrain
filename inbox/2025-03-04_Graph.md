# Graph

After we created [[2025-03-04_Grade-Hallucinations-Chain|Grade Hallucinations Chain]] and [[2025-03-04_Answer-Grader-Chain|Answer Grader Chain]], we can now keep building our graph with conditional edge.

File: /home/matt/Projects/langgraph-course/graph/graph.py
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
from graph.consts import RETRIEVE, GRADE_DOCUMENTS, GENERATE, WEBSEARCH
from graph.nodes import generate, grad_documents, retrieve, websearch
from graph.state import GraphState
from graph.chains.hallucination_grader import hallucination_grader, GradeHallucinations
from graph.chains.answer_grader import answer_grader, GradeAnswer


load_dotenv()

workflow = StateGraph(GraphState)

workflow.add_node(RETRIEVE, retrieve)
workflow.add_node(GRADE_DOCUMENTS, grad_documents)
workflow.add_node(WEBSEARCH, websearch)
workflow.add_node(GENERATE, generate)

workflow.set_entry_point(RETRIEVE)
workflow.add_edge(RETRIEVE, GRADE_DOCUMENTS)

def decide_to_generate(state: GraphState) -> str:
    print("---ASSESS GRADED DOCUMENTS---")

    if state["web_search"]:
        print(
            "---DECISION: NOT ALL DOCUMENTS ARE NOT RELEVANT TO QUESTION---"
        )
        return WEBSEARCH

    print("---DECISION: ALL DOCUMENTS ARE RELEVANT TO QUESTION---")
    return GENERATE

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    GRADE_DOCUMENTS,
    decide_to_generate,
    {
        WEBSEARCH: WEBSEARCH,
        GENERATE: GENERATE,
    }
)
workflow.add_edge(WEBSEARCH, GENERATE)

# workflow.add_edge(GENERATE, END) # instead of this, we want to add a conditional edge after GENERATE node
# create the logic for the conditional edge
def grade_generation_grounded_in_documents_and_question(state: GraphState) -> str:
    print("---CHECK HALLUCIATIONS---")
    question = state["question"]
    documnents = state["documents"]
    generation = state["generation"]

    score = hallucination_grader.invoke(
        {"documents": documnents, "generation": generation}
    )
    
    if isinstance(score, GradeHallucinations):
        score = score.binary_score
        if score:
            print("---DECISION: GENERATION IS GROUNDED IN DOCUMENTS---")
            score = answer_grader.invoke(
                {"question": question, "generation": generation}
            )
            if isinstance(score, GradeAnswer):
                score = score.binary_score
                if score:
                    print("---DECISION: ANSWER ADDRESSSES QUESTION---")
                    return 'useful' # instead of node name, we return a meaningful string, and we'll map it to the node name in the third argument
                print("---DECISION: ANSWER DOES NOT ADDRESS QUESTION---")
                return 'not useful' # instead of node name, we return a meaningful string, and we'll map it to the node name in the third argument
            else:
                raise ValueError("Answer grader did not return a valid score.")
        else:
            print("---DECISION: GENERATION IS NOT GROUNDED IN DOCUMENTS---")
            return 'not supported' # instead of node name, we return a meaningful string, and we'll map it to the node name in the third argument
    else:
        raise ValueError("Hallucination grader did not return a valid score.")
    
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    GENERATE,
    grade_generation_grounded_in_documents_and_question, # logic function
    # mapping of the meaningful string to the node name
    {
        'useful': END,
        'not useful': WEBSEARCH,
        'not supported': GENERATE
    }
)

graph = workflow.compile()

```

Then, we can invoke the above graph in our main file with question "What is agent memory?".


File: /home/matt/Projects/langgraph-course/main.py
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from graph.graph import graph


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello Advanced RAG")
    print(graph.invoke(input={"question": "What is agent memory?"}))
```

Run the main file and see the output.

```bash
Ôê≤ python main.py

Hello Advanced RAG
---RETRIEVE---
---CHECK DOCUMENT RELEVANCE TO QUESTION---
---ASSESS GRADED DOCUMENTS---
---DECISION: NOT ALL DOCUMENTS ARE NOT RELEVANT TO QUESTION---
---WEB SEARCH---
---GENERATE---

---DECISION: GENERATION IS GROUNDED IN DOCUMENTS---
---DECISION: ANSWER ADDRESSSES QUESTION---
{
    'question': 'What is agent memory?',
    'generation': 'Agent memory refers to the capability of AI models to retain and recall information across interactions, allowing them to build on previous conversations rather than treating each query as a new one. It typically includes short-term memory, which utilizes in-context learning, and long-term memory, which enables the retention of information over extended periods. This memory system is crucial for enhancing the planning and decision-making abilities of AI agents.',
    'web_search': True,
    'documents': [
        Document(...),
        Document(...)
    ]
}

```

## The point of this graph

The key point of this graph is that we choose to use multiple chains in the conditional edge, instead of creating a separate node for each chain. This makes our graph more concise and easier to understand.
