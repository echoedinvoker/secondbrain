# Next 14.2 is causing issues with next auth

Next 14.2 was recently released and is causing issues with next-auth. For now, we are requiring the use of a more stable version until this gets sorted out.

When generating your project, use the following version:

```bash
npx create-next-app@14.0.2
```

>Please do not ignore this guidance as your signout functions will not work correctly.


**GitHub Issue link:**

This issue is currently still unresolved as of next-auth 5.0.0-beta.19.

eg:

https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/11125


**If you really need to use Next.js 14.2+**

If it is crucial for you to use the 14.2+ version of Next.js, we provide a workaround later in the course when the logout action is moved to a client component:
