# Taking a Look at Mockups

We want to create a new project which will be a web application. We can upload PDF files to the application and AI models will extract the text from the PDF files and reply users with the extracted text.

Below is the mockup of the application:

Logged in users can see the list of PDF files they uploaded and they can upload new PDF files.

Clicking on the button `View` of a PDF file will go to the page as below:

Left side is a chatbot which will reply the extracted text from the PDF file on the right side.

And users can give feedback to the AI model about its reply.
