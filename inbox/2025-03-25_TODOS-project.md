# TODOS project

- In this project, we will focus to TODOS management system.
- New Information will include:
    - Full SQL Database
    - Authentication
    - Authorization
    - Hashing Passwords

- We'll create new Todo Table Models for our application
- We'll be using these Todos to save records throughout this project

We're going to have our web page that communicates with our fastAPI server, and now we're going to be adding a database that will communicate with our fastAPI application.

Now our web page and our fastAPI is what's going to be dealing with JWT and finding out what's authenticated. However, our fastAPI and databases was going to be retrieving the user and the todos from the database to validate against what client or the web page is sending over to our fastAPI application.

We're going to go over very modern ways on how to deal with the security and everything that we need to be able to create a professional fastAPI application.
