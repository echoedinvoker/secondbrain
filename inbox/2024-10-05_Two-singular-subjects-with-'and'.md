# Two Singular Subjects with "and"

At times we may have two singular subjects in our sentences.

"Mum **enjoys** gardening."

"Dad also **enjoys** gardening!" -- still **singular** verb because mum and dad are on the **separate** sentences.

"Both mum and dad really **enjoy** gardening in the summer!" -- **plural** verb because mum and dad are in the **same** sentence.


> Even if you know it is plural through context, two subjects must be in the same sentence in order for the singular verb to become a plural verb. That is just the way it is.
