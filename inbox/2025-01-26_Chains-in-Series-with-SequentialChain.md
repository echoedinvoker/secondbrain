# Chains in Series with SequentialChain

In the course video, the instructor uses *SequentialChain* to achieve the effect of chaining multiple chains.

However, this is the method of the old version of LangChain.

In the new version of LangChain, this effect is achieved using a pipeline of Runnable Objects, which is simpler and more intuitive.

We already done it in the [[2025-01-26_Connecting-Chains-Together|Connecting Chains Together]].
