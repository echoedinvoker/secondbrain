# Pronounciation: a: different sound changes in different parts of the UK

ɑː is the most common vowel sound in the English. But it is pronounced differently in different parts of the UK. In the North of England, the Midlands, and Scotland, people are more likely to pronounce it as /æ/ instead of /ɑː/.

The most typical example is the pronunciation of `bath`, with people in the south pronouncing it as /bɑːθ/ and people in the north pronouncing it as /bæθ/.
