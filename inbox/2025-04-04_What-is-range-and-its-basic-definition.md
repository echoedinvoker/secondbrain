# What is range and its basic definition

## What is range?

It means that the market is running up and down in a horizontal area without a valid breakout.

Being able to recognize the range is very important because the range represents the market noise. We should avoid trading within the range because it carries high risk and may lead to losses.


## Basic definition of range

Close price is still within a SINGLE candle after 2-5 candles.
