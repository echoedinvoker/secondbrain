# Books2 project
In this project, we need to create a class `Book` to generate Book objects as the data structure for books.

In addition to the basic endpoints for CRUD operations, we need to implement the following features in this project:
- Data Validation
- Exception Handling
- Status Codes
- Swagger Configuration
- Python Requests Objects
