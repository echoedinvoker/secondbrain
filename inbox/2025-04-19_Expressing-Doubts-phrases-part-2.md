# Expressing Doubts phrases part 2

## Could go either way

Basically means we're unsure of the outcome or result of something. It could be good, or it could be bad. Whatever it may be.

"Honestly, it could go either way. They seemed interested, but still up in the air I guess."

 *up in the air* is a really good idiomatic phrase to say. Basically means there's no real result or outcome decided yet.


 ## On the fence

 You'll hear this a lot from a range of native English speakers. It's a idomatic expression basically means undecided.

 "Still on the fence about joining. It sounds fun but might be a waste of money.

 There's a few words actually missing from this sentence. I think it's quite a good one just to quickly talk about. Really, there should be a pronoun at the start. The subject. I am, I'm still on the fence about joining.


 ## Bit sceptical

 You can also say "a bit sceptical", usually about something. Sceptical means you doubt it. You might not believe it. You don't think this is good.

 "Bit sceptical about that app. I mean, it talks a big game but surely it can't deliver all that for the cost?"

 *talks a big game*, this is a great expression used by British people. It often means that you speak very well, but your actions aren't as good.


 ## Too good to be true

 Again, doubting something you believe something maybe talking a big game and you don't think it's going to deliver.

 "Ten pounds for a pair of designer trainers? That's way too good to be true, surely."

 So, yeah, that's probably a scam. And this phrase kind of points that out.
