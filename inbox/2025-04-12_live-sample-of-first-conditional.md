# live sample of first conditional

We use the first conditional to express doubt and it can be quite useful if you want to talk about doubts or say you are unsure about something.


Q1: "Do you want to see another doctor?

"If I see another doctor, I'll only get more confused."
                           ^^^ contracted form of "will"
                               native speaker don't use "I will"
                               pretty much always use "I'll"


Q2: "Would you like to meet on Friday evening?"

"If we meet on Friday, I'll get in trouble with my wife."

Again, use the contracted form of "will" to improve your overall native sounding fluency.
