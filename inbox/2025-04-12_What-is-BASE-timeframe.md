# What is BASE timeframe

Before using the technique of multiple timeframes, we need to choose a BASE timeframe.

## What is BASE timeframe

BASE timeframe is the time frame we use to set entry, stop loss, and take profit prices, so it must be the time frame that makes us feel most comfortable.

When the timeframe is too small, we need to spend more time watching the market, which will lead to increased stress.

When the time frame is too large, we may miss some opportunities and this can lead to a discrepancy between our expectations, causing anxiety.

So we need to choose a time frame that is just right for us, one that makes us the most comfortable and generates the least amount of pressure.

In addition to the BASE timeframe, the other timeframes used in multiple timeframes techniques are only auxiliary. We will not directly use them to set entry, stop loss, and take profit prices.

If you are unsure about which time frame is most suitable for you, it is recommended to choose a 15-minute time frame as the BASE time frame.


## BASE timeframe and RR

Choosing different BASE time frames will result in different RR that can be obtained within the same time period.

**M15**: Wait 5 days to have 1 chance with RR >= 3 -> You will have 12R profit per month

**H1**: Wait 7-8 days to have 1 chance with RR >= 3 -> You will have 9R profit per month

**H4**: Wait 20 days to have 1 chance with RR >= 3 -> You will have 3R profit per month

Assuming we use a risk of 1 for each opportunity above, the expected return rate per month would be:

- M15: 12%
- H1: 9%
- H4: 3%

However, usually in longer time frames we will use more risk for trading, so assuming we use 2 times the risk for trading in the H1 and H4 time frames, then our expected return rate will be:

- M15: still 12% because this is not big timeframe
- H1: 18% double risk
- H4: 6% double risk

I suggest only using 1 risk for trading, because even though there are fewer trading opportunities on a larger timeframe, losing 2 risks at once will still make you feel frustrated, and having fewer chances will make you feel impatient because you really want to quickly win back the money.

Therefore, I still recommend using only 1 risk for trading regardless of the timeframe. I believe that M15 is the most suitable as the base timeframe because using H1 or H4 with 1 risk for trading may create discrepancies with your expectations, leading to feelings of frustration.
