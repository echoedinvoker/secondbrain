# Six groups of Connectives

Below, I will roughly divide common conjunctions into six categories, but some conjunctions may belong to different categories in different contexts.

For example, "then" can be used to indicate sequence, as well as to indicate result.

However, this classification can make it easier for you to use them in conversation or writing.

*Adding*
and also
as well as
moreover
too
furthermore
additionally
in addition
besides

*Sequencing*
first
second
third
next
after
meanwhile
finally  
subsequently
then

*Cause and Effect*
because
so
therefore
consequently
as a result
thus

*Comparing*
likewise
equally
in the same way
like
similarly
compared to
as...as

*Qualifying*
but
however
although
unless
except
apart from
yet
nevertheless

*Contrasting*
whereas
instead of
or
otherwise
unlike
on the other hand
in contrast
conversely
