# Early bird Night owl

If you say someone is or you are, I describe mysielf as I'm a realy early bird. That just means I always wake up early.

"I'm a real early bird. I always get up at 6 a.m. No matter what day it is."


At the complete opposite end of the spectrum, you can either describe yourself or someone else as a night owl. Generally, you can't be a night owl and an early bird at the same time unless you don't really sleep much at night.

Night owl is a person that generally will stay up much later than most people, possibly past midnight. They tend to sleep maybe two, three o'clock every day, and it's often by choice.
