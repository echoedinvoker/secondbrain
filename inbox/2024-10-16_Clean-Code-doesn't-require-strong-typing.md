# Clean Code doesn't require strong typing

```typescript
function add(num1: number, num2: number) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

Types can help preventing errors and can improve readability

But code can also be 100% readable and meaningful without types

```python
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```
