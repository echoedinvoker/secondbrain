# Examples of always, usually and generally

"How often do you exercise?"

"I always exercise in the morning before work." (100%)

"I usually exercise in the evening after work." (80%)

"I generally exercise on weekends." (70%)


We can have these adverbs of frequency kind of in that positive range.
