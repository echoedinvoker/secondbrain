# Dive into three of comparing phrases

**Similar, Similar to**

- My brother is **similar to** me.
- We are **similar** in many ways.

Both "similar" are adjectives, but the first one is used with the preposition "to" to compare two objects, while the second one is used as a predicate adjective to describe the subject directly.


**the Same as, Samey**

- The weather in England is **the same as** in Scotland.
- All these houses look **samey**.
- Those cars are pretty **samey** really.

"the same as" is used to compare two objects formally, while "samey" is an informal adjective to describe things that are very similar or identical in a slightly negative way.

"same" in the first sentence is a pronoun, while "samey" in the second and third sentences is an adjective.


**Akin to**

- Football is **akin to** rugby.
- The two companies are **akin** in their business practices.

"akin" is always used as an adjective, and it means "similar to" or "related to" formally and even academically.

When "akin" is used with "to", it is used to compare two objects, while "akin" is used alone, it usually be followed by "in" to describe the similarity between the subjects.
