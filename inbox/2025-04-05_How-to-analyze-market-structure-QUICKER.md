# How to analyze market structure QUICKER

1. Determine the current trend by simply looking the chart.

2. What we are most concerned about is the key level, so we need to quickly find a valid pullback. Therefore, we need to start looking for candles opposite to the current trend and if they meet the following criteria:
    - Two maru candles continuously
    - 3-4 candles continuously (Must have maru)
    - A big maru and a small candle

According to the above two steps, we can accelerate the analysis of market structure. We will actually apply it in the next assignment.
