# Proactive

Proactive is something that most people try to strive to be. Proactie means that you are enthusiastic to complete tasks, to find useful activities to do.

"I've been really proactive recently in contacting friends and messageing family, really proactive in developing communications with close relates."

So it's generally used in a positive way.

"I really want to be more proactive about exercise."

"I really want to be more proactive about learning this language. I want to do it more. And I want to find more reasons to do useful activities."
