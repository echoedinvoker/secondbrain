# Clauses in sentences

Sentences are made of smaller chunks of language called clauses.

There are two types of clauses:

## Independent clauses
A complete idea and sentence. A complete thought.

"The music is very loud."

"Dogs like to get lots of exercise."

"It's going to rain tomorrow I think."

## Dependent clauses
Not a complete idea and isn't fully finished. Adds detail.

"It seems very clear to me ..."

"When my syster arrives ..."

"... who walked out to the park."
