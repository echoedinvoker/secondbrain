# Love it

It's definitely quite a basic piece of vocabulary and expression put together, but I think that it's important to be able to pronounce it properly.

"I love it"

"I love food"

Some people may say "love it" and really separate those two words. When in fact we really group them together and say "lov-it". 

And actually we can also get rid of "t" sound at the end of "it" and just say "I lov-i". You can just get that sound and then it stops really *sharply*. That is a very advanced pronunciation technique of native speakers.

"Oh, football is great, I love it!"
                          /Lʌvɪ/
                          no "t" sound at the end, but stop sharply
