# Qualifying connectives

- but
- however 
- although
- unless
- except
- apart from


We use "qualifying" connectives to show a difference between things or change of thinking.

```py
"I really hope the flight isn't delayed although I wouldn't mind getting food at the airport."
#                                       ^^^^^^^^
```
