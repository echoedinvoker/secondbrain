# 5 or 6 Ws for description

At times during conversation, you will need to develop stories or give extra details.

I use a poem by Rudyard Kipling to help me remember the 6 Ws: What, Why, When, How, Where, Who.

```py
"""
I keep six honest serving men  
(they taught me all I knew);  
their names are What and Why and  
When and How and Where and Who.

 - Rudyard Kipling
