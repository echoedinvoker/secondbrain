# Get into the habit

It really does sound like we're moving ourselve into a habit, something that we do often without thinking.

It basically means to do something quite a few times and it's becoming, but no quite yet, a habit. It's like a habit in the making.

"I'm reading so much more. I'm really getting into the habit of reading before bed."

So it's not the complete end where it's a habit now, but it's getting there, obviously at times in a positive way.

"I'm getting into the habit of exercising every day."

"I'm getting into the habit of eating healthier foods."
