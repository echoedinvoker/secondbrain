# structure of the first conditional

If the grammatical structure of the first conditional is wrong, then we sound really unfluent.

So to sound more fluent, we must to be very careful with how we structure and organize the different pieces of the first conditional.

Below are some first conditional sentences, but we will analyze their structure more in depth:

"If I sleep well, I will feel good tomorrow."
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
   present simple future tense (don't forget the auxiliary verb "will")


"If I eat watermelon, I will get a stomach cramp."
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
   present simple future tense (don't forget the auxiliary verb "will")
