# Has your family thought about moving?

Here we can use the past perfect continuous to show that we considered it, but we had doubts. We can express doubts with the past perfect continuous.

"We had been thinking about moving but we decided to stay here."
    ^^^


Similarly, we can say in the present perfect continuous that we thinking about it before and now.

"We have been thinking about moving, although we're not too sure now."
