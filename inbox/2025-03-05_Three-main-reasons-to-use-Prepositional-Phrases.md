# Three main reasons to use Prepositional Phrases

We use prepositional phrases are for three main reasons:


1. To give information for time

"We'll be meeting *at* 9pm."


2. To give information for location

"I usually head *to* work `for` around 8:30am."

`for` is also a preposition which used to give information for time.


3. To give information for direction

"We can go *over* the wall `to` the park"

`to` is also a preposition which used to give information for location.


These are the three main reasons to use prepositional phrases, but there are quite a few more reasons to use them.

Sentences 2 and 3 have multiple prepositional phrases in them. So we can see prepositional phrases are used a lot in English.
