# Alias

We can use an alias to rename a column or table in the result set of a query.

Setting an alias for a calculated column is common:
```sql
SELECT name, population / area AS density FROM cities;
--                             ^^^^^^^^^^ alias for calculated column
```

After setting an alias, we can't use the original column name in the following clauses, but you need to note the [[2025-04-20_Execution-order-of-clauses|execution order of clauses]], clauses before the alias must use the original column name.
