# Model verbs with example sentences

Typically, a modal verb is followed by a *base form of a verb* (infinitive without "to"). For example:


"She must study for the exam."

We are speculating and we're saying it must happen.


"He can speak multiple languages."

That's saying about ability, It can happen, something is possible.


"They might arrive a little late."

We think about it, it's kind of a 50/50 chance.
