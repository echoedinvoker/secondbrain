# Reward Risk ratio

## Definition

Reward Risk ratio is a measure of the potential reward of an investment relative to its risk, the formula is:

```py
reward_risk_ratio = (Take Profit - Entry Price) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss)
```

It is recommended to only trade when this value is greater than 2. Following this principle can give you long-term stable profit opportunities.

We can use TradingView's drawing tools to directly calculate the Reward Risk ratio on the chart, so we can more intuitively see the risk-reward ratio of each trade.
