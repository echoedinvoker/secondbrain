# Market cycle

When the trend changes, we call it a market cycle. 

There are two types of market cycles:

## Key level break

When the price of the key level is broken, the trend changes.


## Meet Opposite Key Level of Higher Time Frame

When the price meets the opposite key level of the higher time frame, the trend changes.

For example, when the 1-hour chart is in an uptrend and then produces an up key level, the price continues to rise. However, when it reaches the down key level on the 4-hour chart, it starts to fall. At this point, the uptrend on the 1-hour chart has ended. It is not advisable to enter a buy position at the up key level on the 1-hour chart because it is no longer valid at that point.
