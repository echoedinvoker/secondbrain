# Modelled Conversation


## Scripts

Julian: Here, Alex - take your ticket mate.

Alex: Cheers. How much was that?

Julian: Don’t worry about it, I’ll pay for this. So what were you up to over the summer?

Alex: Loads of stuff really. I took up a new sport, which was pretty fun.

Julian: Nice, you’ve always been into trying out new things. Which new sport did you start?

Alex: Well, it sounds kind of strange, but actually I got really into paragliding!

Julian: Paragliding?!

Alex: Yes, I thought you’d think it was kind of weird. But yeah.. I’m really loving it! My cousin suggested I give it a go. She’s about to become an instructor in it.

Julian: Were you not petrified about doing it?!

Alex: Well, I suppose a bit! Like I said my cousin’s experienced so I wasn’t too worried and also the equipment is brand new and super safe.

Julian: Okay, but you’d never get me trying it!

Alex: How about you, Julian? Did you have a good summer?

Julian: It was good, but probably a bit dull compared to yours! I spent most of my time taking it easy and reading in the garden. I’m a real bookworm these days! Pretty different to paragliding right?

Alex: Definitely! But to be honest, I should really pick up a book more often. I haven’t read much at all recently.

Julian: Don’t worry, I’ll lend you a few books. I’m a big fan of sports biographies. How does that sound?

Alex: Excellent! Bring one over to my house later. Anyway, here’s our stop!
