# Zero Shot Prompt

If a prompt does not have any examples, input data, context, and guidelines, it is called a Zero Shot Prompt.

The AI model must use its preexisting knowledge to generate answers. This is usually sufficient, as AI models are typically trained on billions of words, so they already have enough knowledge to respond to zero-shot prompts.

However, using zero-shot prompts, we cannot precisely control the AI model's response because it is based on its preexisting knowledge.

In the example above, the prompt is zero-shot because it does not provide any examples, input data, context, or guidelines.

But AI models can still generate a beautiful list to answer the prompt with its preexisting knowledge.

Usually, ordinary users use zero-shot prompts to engage in conversations because it is a very intuitive way to ask questions.
