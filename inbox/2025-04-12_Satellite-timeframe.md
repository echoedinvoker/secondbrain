# Satellite timeframe

Satellite timeframe includes Higher timeframe (HTF) and Lower timeframe (LTF), where higher and lower are defined in relation to the BASE timeframe.


## Choosing the Satellite timeframe

The choice of BASE timeframe is determined by subjective factors such as personality, expectations, life conditions, and high pressure resistance. However, the Satellite timeframe is entirely determined by the length of the BASE timeframe, which is objective.

**Higher timeframe (HTF)**
We usually choose a HTF that is four times longer than the BASE timeframe as the Higher timeframe (HTF). Assuming the BASE timeframe is 15 minutes, then the Higher timeframe (HTF) would be 1 hour.

**Lower timeframe (LTF)**
We usually choose LTF that is lower than the BASE timeframe at 3~5 times. Assuming the BASE timeframe is 15 minutes, then the Lower timeframe (LTF) would be 5 minutes.


## Functionality of each timeframe

**BASE timeframe**
1. Analyze market structure, zone, momentum of zone
2. Give out entry, stop loss, take profit, and risk management

**Higher timeframe (HTF)**
1. Check market condition now (whether it's nice or noise)
2. Check risk: whether market comes to a risk place that create a suddent move in the near future
3. Optimize TP place: having a bigger TP on market cycle

**Lower timeframe (LTF)**
1. Check pullback wave to trail profit


***Explanation of each point***

The momentum of the zone mentioned in the first point of the BASE timeframe refers to the situation where we see very small candles, or even a candle with a horizontal line, along with a lot of gaps in the chart. It is obvious that the momentum and liquidity are very low in this case, so it is not suitable for trading.

The second point in HTF refers to the occurrence of sudden moves when price encounters key zones in HTF. If the direction is different from the entry, it will result in extremely high risk.

The third point of HTF and the first point of LTF are used together. We can change the take profit price from the original base to using HTF to achieve higher profits, but in the process, we need to use LTF to tail profit.

> For new trader, I recommend to set a fixed TP at recent high/low always and just trade if RR >= 2 times.

(In fact, in some cases, LTF can replace BASE to find more trading opportunities, but this is a very advanced technique, so we must do a lot of work for it. This technique will probably be learned in the level 4 course.)
