# Using in question form

In the past tense:

Had + subject + been verb(ing)

"Had she been playing tennis for very long?"

Now, that indicates that I know this girl has stopped playing tennis.


In the present tense:

Has + subject + been verb(ing)

"Has she been playing tennis for very long?"

Which is to say that she started previously, is still playing now.
