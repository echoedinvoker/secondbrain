# Pulse wave and Pullback wave

**Pulse wave**
When in an uptrend, a continuous increase in price is called a pulse wave, whereas when in a downtrend, a continuous decrease in price is called a pulse wave.

**Pullback wave**
When the Pulse wave is running, power and liquidity will continuously decrease. At this time, a Pullback wave will appear, which is a market trend opposite to the direction of the trend. Its appearance is to allow power and liquidity to return to a reasonable level so that the next Pulse wave can reach a new high (or low) again.

**Count Waves**
We will individually calculate how many times the pulse wave and pullback wave have appeared in this market trend, calculating from left to right.
For example:
- 1st pulse wave
- 1st pullback wave
- 2nd pulse wave
- 2nd pullback wave
- 3rd pulse wave
- 3rd pullback wave
