# Big marubozu candle and one confirmation candle (different color)

## Conditions

- First candle must be BIG
compared with 5 recent **maru** candles on the left side. It should be at least greater than all 5 candles, better if it is obviously bigger than the biggest one of them.

- The second candle's low point should be greater than the middle point of the first candle.

**Extra conditions for reverse second candle**
- When the color of the second candle is opposite to the color of the first candle, two conditions must be met:
    - The second candle must be SMALL compared with the first candle. It's length must be less than 30% of the first candle.
    - The second candle should be doji or pinbar.
