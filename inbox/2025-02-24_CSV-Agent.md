# CSV Agent

We created a separate file generation agent specifically for querying CSV files.

```sh
 tree
.
├── callbacks.py
├── csv_agent.py  # new file to create CSV agent
├── episode_info.csv # csv file downloaded from the web
├── main.py
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
└── qrcodes
```

We can simply use the method `create_csv_agent` provided by Langchaing to create an agent that can use a tool to query CSV content.

This method will create a tool based on PythonREPLTool, and analyze the CSV file to create some query syntax for that particular CSV file. 

We also need to install the `pandas` and `tabulate` library for this agent to work.

```sh
pipenv install pandas tabulate
```

File: /home/matt/Projects/code-interpreter/csv_agent.py
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_experimental.agents import create_csv_agent


def main():
    csv_agent_executor = create_csv_agent(
#   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ create_csv_agent returns an AgentExecutor object
#                      because it includes while loop
        llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4o-mini"),
        path="episode_info.csv",
        verbose=True,
        allow_dangerous_code=True # because this function is based on PythonREPLTool, it is dangerous, so we need to allow it
    )

    # Then, we can ask questions about the CSV file, this agent will automatically parse the CSV file and answer the question
    csv_agent_executor.invoke(
        input={"input": "how many columns are there in file episode_info.csv"},
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's run this script and see the output.

```sh
 python csv_agent.py


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: To determine the number of columns in the dataframe `df`, I can use the `shape` attribute, which returns a tuple where the first element is the n
umber of rows and the second element is the number of columns. I will access the second element of this tuple to get the number of columns.

Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df.shape[1]8I now know the final answer
Final Answer: There are 8 columns in the dataframe `df`.

> Finished chain.
```

From the format above, it can be seen that this agent is also a ReAct agent, but it has made some special processing for querying CSV files, allowing users to directly ask questions without having to write their own program to query.


## Combine the Python agent

Next, we will integrate this agent with the Python agent from the previous topic's Python agent, and add a route agent to distribute tasks to relevant agents for processing.
