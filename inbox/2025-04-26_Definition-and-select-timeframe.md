There are three timeframes:

- Trading TF: market sructure

- Entry TF: entry / stoploss
Using small timeframe to find the entry position and stoploss to minimize the risk.


## How to find your trading timeframe?

It depends on your trading style:

- Scalping: 1m, 2m, 5m
- Swing: 15m, 1h, 4h
- Investing: daily, weekly, monthly

You need to understand yourself:

- Your personality:
    - hot-tempered
    - patient
    - optimistic

    If you are a hot-tempered person, do not do scalping, because when you lose, you will revenge trade and lose more money.


- Your strategy:
    - Good
    - Excellent
    - Expert

    Scalping need a expert strategy. After the course, you may have a excellent strategy, but you still need to practice it for about 3-6 months to become a expert.

- Your time:
    - Full-time
    - Part-time

    If you are a full-time trader, you can do scalping, if not, you can do swing trading or investing.
