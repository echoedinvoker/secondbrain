# Finally... Parallel Tests! (Final Lecture)

Now, we can copy codes of beforAll and afterAll from the previous lecture to each test files.

```sh
 tree src
src
├── app.js
├── pool.js
├── repos
├── routes
└── test
    ├── context.js
    └── routes
        ├── users.test.js # we implemented this in the previous lecture
        ├── users-three.test.js # copy from users.test.js and paste here
        └── users-two.test.js # copy from users.test.js and paste here
```

Now, every test file starts with the same code like this:

```js
// ...

let context;

beforeAll(async () => {
  context = await Context.bulid();

});

afterAll(() => {
  return context.close();
});

// ...

```
Another thing that can be done is to delete all records in the database before each test, so that each test starts from a clean state. This is optional.

We add a method to the class Context to perform this operation.

```js

// ...

class Context {
  static async bulid() { ... }

  constructor(roleName) {
    this.roleName = roleName;
  }

  // this method is used to clean up the database
  async reset() {
    await pool.query(`
      DELETE FROM users;
    `) // if there are any other tables, we need to delete them too
  }

  async close() { ... }
}

module.exports = Context;
```

Now, we can call this method in the beforeEach method of each test file.

```js
// ...

let context;

beforeAll(async () => { ... });

// this method is used to clean up the database before each test
beforeEach(async () => {
  await context.reset();
})

afterAll(() => { ... });

// ...

```
