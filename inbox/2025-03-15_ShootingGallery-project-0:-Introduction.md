# ShootingGallery project 0: Introduction

This is a simple shooting gallery game.

Once the game starts, the timer starts ticking down and the player's goal is to shoot as many targets as possible before the timer runs out. Each target hit will increase the player's score.

This is an excellent project for beginners to learn the basics of game development by using the Love2D framework because it covers the following basic concepts:
- displaying graphics to the screen
- keeping score
- using time
- clicking with the mouse
