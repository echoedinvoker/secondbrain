## Scripts

Sam: Oh, hi Dao. Great to see you here!

Dao: Hi Sam - it’s been too long! How’s everything going with you?

Sam: Pretty good thanks, just busy with university and trying to get into my study books. How’ve you been?

Dao: So-so I guess. I’m trying hard to pass this new course I enrolled into. But I really wouldn’t bet on it! There’s way too much coursework to complete and I don’t have the time to finish it all.

Sam: I can imagine it’s pretty intense, Dao! Do you need any help?

Dao: No, but thanks for the offer. Right from the get go the teacher was setting assignments. What a nightmare!

Sam: But you know, sometimes you’ve just got to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Dao: Ah, I suppose you’re right. How’s your degree studies going?

Sam: It’s 50/50 really. The assignments are sometimes quite okay, but the lectures can be like watching paint dry. Seriously, I find it hard to stay awake sometimes!

Dao: Well, I suppose some teachers are more interesting than others. They’re all quite different.

Sam: Yeah, that’s very true. Other than studies, lifes been a blast. I took a weekend trip to the Lake District a few weeks ago.

Dao: Wow! I still haven’t visited there. What was it like?

Sam: It’s really beautiful and there are so many small villages to look around. If you finish your coursework early, I recommend it!

Dao: I’d love to but let’s see!
