# Internal structure

Internal structure refers to the structure formed between the key level and the recent high (or recent low when downtrend).

Key levels may also occur in the internal structure, but we will not trade based on them. We only focus on trading at the main key level.

When the price breaks through the recent high (or recent low) and then produces a pullback wave then reaching a new high (or new low), the main key level will change position. At this point, we will trade based on the new main key level and the new recent high (or recent low).

In any case, we consider the internal structure as noise, and we only focus on trading at the main key level.
