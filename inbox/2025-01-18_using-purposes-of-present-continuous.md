# using purposes of present continuous

The present continuous is used mainly for 3 reasons.


## 1. Actions happening right now!

Most people misunderstand that the **simple present tense** is used to describe actions happening now, when in fact the **present continuous** is.

```py
"The guests are arriving now"

"The computer is loading"
```

## 2. A longer action in progress

This does not necessarily mean that the action is currently in progress, but rather that the action is a longer-term progress, which can be described using the present continuous tense to cover the current time.

```py
"I'm studying to learn English"
# It's not means that I'm studying right now, but it's a longer-term progress that I'm currently doing.

"She's practising martial arts"
# It's not means that she's practising right now, but it's a longer-term progress that she's currently doing.
```

## 3. Near future plans

```py
"We're going on holiday next week"
#            ^^^^^^^^^^ means vacation
# `are going` means that it's a near future plan.

"I'm seeing my friends tomorrow"
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not means that I'm seeing my friends right now, but it's a near future plan. There is no `is going` in this sentence but we can still know that it's a near future plan because of the `tomorrow`.

```
