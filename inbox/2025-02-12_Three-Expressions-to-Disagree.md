# Three Expressions to Disagree

## I see your point, but I have a different opinion...

"I see your point about the new policy, but I have a different opinion. It might be too strict so let's try and edit it a little bit."


## I'm leaning towards a different idea/plan...

"That's an interesting idea about going for a jog but I'm leaning towards a different plan - maybe a yoga class or something?"


## I'm not sure I'm feeling that...

`I'm fealing that` is a bit idiomatic and slangy. It's not a formal expression but still polite.

"I understand the suggestion of trying a new hobby, but I'm not sure I'm feeling that. Maybe we could explore photography instead?"
