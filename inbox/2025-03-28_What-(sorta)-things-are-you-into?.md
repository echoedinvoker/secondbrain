# What (sorta) things are you into?

It's a question, actually, and you can use it when you want to discuss hobbies and interests with people. And that "what sorta", you don't have to use "sorta".

When you say "what are you into", that's really an idiom to say, what do you like.

"What things are you into?"

"What sorta things are you into?"
