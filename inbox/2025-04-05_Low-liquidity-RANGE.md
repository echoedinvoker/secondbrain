# Low liquidity RANGE

Smalles doji can create a range also but these ranges are easily broken. So we usually just skip them and keep analyzing the market structure.

Just focus on the big maru/pinbar creating the range.

We can use the last 5 maru candles to determine if the candle is big or small.
