# Past Perfect

An event in the past that happend before another action in the past. We focus on the event that happened first.

Subject + had + past participle + ...

`had` is auxiliary verb for past perfect tense, and `past participle` is the main verb in past participle form such as `eaten`, `gone`, `seen`, `done`, etc.

"After *he had finished* his work, he went to bed."

Both events happened in the past, but one event happened before the other event. We focus on the event that happened first.

"When *they had eaten* their dinner, they played a game of cards."

The first event is eating dinner, and the second event is playing cards. We focus on the event that happened first. But both events happened in the past.
