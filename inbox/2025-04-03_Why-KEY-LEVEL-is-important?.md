# Why KEY LEVEL is important?

We use key levels to determine the entry and stoploss points, and use it to determine if the trend is changing. But why are key levels so important?

In order to explain the importance of the key level, we must start from the beginning to tell the story of an uptrend:

1. **first pulse wave**
When the price keeps rising, buying pressure and liquidity will decrease because no one wants to buy expensive things, everyone wants to buy cheaper.

2. **first pullback**
When liquidity is low, some sellers may try to slowly sell off because they are still afraid that there is buying pressure pushing the price up.

When the price indeed goes down, it will increase the confidence of the seller, leading to further increase in selling pressure.

3. **Key level**
When the price drops to a certain level, there will be a large number of buyers who missed the previous opportunity entering the market. The buying pressure from these buyers must be strong enough to absorb the selling pressure of the pullback. Usually, at this time, the selling pressure of the pullback is the strongest. If the price cannot continue to fall, it means that there is at least an equally strong buying pressure appearing. This forms a key level, which will be an important support because it concentrates the most liquidity.

4. **second pulse wave**
The seller saw that the price could not fall any further, so they began to buy back, coupled with strong buying pressure entering at key levels, causing the price to start rising, returning to the state of 1.

## Conclusion
From the above process, we can see that the key level is the point where buyers and sellers battle the most, resulting in the highest liquidity collected here. Therefore, the key level is a very important support level. We can also use whether it is broken to determine if the trend has changed. This is why we use the key level to determine entry and stop-loss points.
