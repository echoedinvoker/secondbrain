# When to expressing certainty and uncertainty

## Certainty

1. We might express certainty when providing factual information or sharing things we know to be true.
2. Certainty is often stressed when giving clear instructions or making definitive statements about future events.

## Uncertainty

1. We may express uncertainty when discussing speculative or unconfirmed plans and arrangements.
2. Uncertainty can be shown to try and influence a decision and stop making bad decisions (think at work!)
