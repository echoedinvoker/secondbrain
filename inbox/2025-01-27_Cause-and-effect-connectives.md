# Cause and effect connectives

We use "cause and effect" connectives to show how events and ideas affect each other.

- **because**
- **so**
- **therefore**
- **consequently**


Examples:

```py
"I tried to finish off my university work early because I had a family gathering that evening."
#                                               ^^^^^^^
```
