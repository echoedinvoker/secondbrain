# Examples of Adding Connectives

We use *adding* connectives to connect ideas and provide additional information in our speaking.

```py
"Well, at first they tried to charge double as well as moving our seats right to the back of the cinema!"
#                                           ^^^^^^^^^^
```
`as well as` is used to join two ideas together, building on information and adding a bit more stress to the situation. In this case, we're adding stress and emphasis that we probably were pretty unhappy about the situation.

You can find that adding connectives contains some implicit messages, which may be emphasis, additional information, or a turn. These adding connectives will make your speech more vivid and interesting, and also make it easier for listeners to understand your meaning.

Below are some more examples of adding connectives and their meanings:

```py
"He's an excellent programmer. Moreover, he's a natural leader."
#                              ^^^^^^^^
```
Implicit information: Emphasizes that the information following may be more important or surprising.


```py
"I don't want to go to the party. Besides, I have a lot of work to do."
#                                 ^^^^^^^
```

Implicit information: Introducing a possibly more persuasive or more important point.
